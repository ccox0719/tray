    "Passage": "Then God said, \u201cLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\u201d\n\nSo God created mankind in his own image,\n    in the image of God he created them;\n    male and female he created them.\nGod blessed them and said to them, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\u201d\n\nThen God said, \u201cI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground\u2014everything that has the breath of life in it\u2014I give every green plant for food.\u201d And it was so.\n\nGod saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the sixth day.\n\nThus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.\n\nBy the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.\n\nThis is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.\n\nNow no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.\n\nNow the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground\u2014trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nA river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n\nThe Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the Lord God commanded the man, \u201cYou are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.\u201d\n\nThe Lord God said, \u201cIt is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\u201d\n\nNow the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.\n\nBut for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man\u2019s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.\n\nThe man said,\n\n\u201cThis is now bone of my bones\n    and flesh of my flesh;\nshe shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019\n    for she was taken out of man.\u201d\nThat is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.\n\nAdam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame."

He said to the woman, \u201cDid God really say, \u2018You can\u2019t eat from any tree in the garden\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe woman said to the serpent, \u201cWe may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden. But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, \u2018You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! You will not die,\u201d the serpent said to the woman. \u201cIn fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d Then the woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.\n\nThen the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid themselves from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. So the Lord God called out to the man and said to him, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\nAnd he said, \u201cI heard You in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.\u201d\n\nThen He asked, \u201cWho told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?\u201d\n\nThen the man replied, \u201cThe woman You gave to be with me\u2014she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate.\u201d\n\nSo the Lord God asked the woman, \u201cWhat is this you have done?\u201d\n\nAnd the woman said, \u201cIt was the serpent. He deceived me, and I ate.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord God said to the serpent:\n\nBecause you have done this,\nyou are cursed more than any livestock\nand more than any wild animal.\nYou will move on your belly\nand eat dust all the days of your life.\nI will put hostility between you and the woman,\nand between your seed and her seed.\nHe will strike your head,\nand you will strike his heel.\nHe said to the woman:\n\nI will intensify your labor pains;\nyou will bear children in anguish.\nYour desire will be for your husband,\nyet he will rule over you.\nAnd He said to Adam, \u201cBecause you listened to your wife\u2019s voice and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, \u2018Do not eat from it\u2019:\n\nThe ground is cursed because of you.\nYou will eat from it by means of painful labor\nall the days of your life.\nIt will produce thorns and thistles for you,\nand you will eat the plants of the field.\nYou will eat bread by the sweat of your brow\nuntil you return to the ground,\nsince you were taken from it.\nFor you are dust,\nand you will return to dust.\u201d\nAdam named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living. The Lord God made clothing out of skins for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them.\n\nThe Lord God said, \u201cSince man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil, he must not reach out, take from the tree of life, eat, and live forever.\u201d So the Lord God sent him away from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove man out and stationed the cherubim and the flaming, whirling sword east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of life."

In the course of time Cain presented some of the land\u2019s produce as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also presented an offering\u2014some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he looked despondent.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won\u2019t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door.

Your brother\u2019s blood cries out to Me from the ground! So now you are cursed, alienated, from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother\u2019s blood you have shed. If you work the ground, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\u201d\n\nBut Cain answered the Lord, \u201cMy punishment is too great to bear! Since You are banishing me today from the soil, and I must hide myself from Your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord replied to him, \u201cIn that case, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.\u201d And He placed a mark on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him. Then Cain went out from the Lord\u2019s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."

    "Passage": "When mankind began to multiply on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of mankind were beautiful, and they took any they chose as wives for themselves. And the Lord said, \u201cMy Spirit will not remain with mankind forever, because they are corrupt. Their days will be 120 years.\u201d The Nephilim were on the earth both in those days and afterward, when the sons of God came to the daughters of mankind, who bore children to them. They were the powerful men of old, the famous men.\n\nWhen the Lord saw that man\u2019s wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every scheme his mind thought of was nothing but evil all the time, the Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. Then the Lord said, \u201cI will wipe off from the face of the earth mankind, whom I created, together with the animals, creatures that crawl, and birds of the sky\u2014for I regret that I made them.\u201d Noah, however, found favor in the sight of the Lord.\n\nThese are the family records of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries; Noah walked with God. And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\nNow the earth was corrupt in God\u2019s sight, and the earth was filled with wickedness. God saw how corrupt the earth was, for every creature had corrupted its way on the earth. Then God said to Noah, \u201cI have decided to put an end to every creature, for the earth is filled with wickedness because of them; therefore I am going to destroy them along with the earth.\n\n\u201cMake yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it with pitch inside and outside. This is how you are to make it: The ark will be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. You are to make a roof, finishing the sides of the ark to within 18 inches of the roof. You are to put a door in the side of the ark. Make it with lower, middle, and upper decks.\n\n\u201cUnderstand that I am bringing a flood\u2014floodwaters on the earth to destroy every creature under heaven with the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will die. But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark with your sons, your wife, and your sons\u2019 wives. You are also to bring into the ark two of all the living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Two of everything\u2014from the birds according to their kinds, from the livestock according to their kinds, and from the animals that crawl on the ground according to their kinds\u2014will come to you so that you can keep them alive. Take with you every kind of food that is eaten; gather it as food for you and for them.\u201d And Noah did this. He did everything that God had commanded him."

Seven days from now I will make it rain on the earth 40 days and 40 nights, and I will wipe off from the face of the earth every living thing I have made.\u201d And Noah did everything that the Lord commanded him.\n\nNoah was 600 years old when the flood came and water covered the earth. So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons\u2019 wives entered the ark because of the waters of the flood. From the clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and every creature that crawls on the ground, two of each, male and female, entered the ark with Noah, just as God had commanded him. Seven days later the waters of the flood came on the earth.\n\nIn the six hundredth year of Noah\u2019s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the sources of the watery depths burst open, the floodgates of the sky were opened, and the rain fell on the earth 40 days and 40 nights. On that same day Noah along with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah\u2019s wife, and his three sons\u2019 wives entered the ark with him. They entered it with all the wildlife according to their kinds, all livestock according to their kinds, the creatures that crawl on the earth according to their kinds, all birds, every fowl, and everything with wings according to their kinds. Two of all flesh that has the breath of life in it entered the ark with Noah. Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered just as God had commanded him. Then the Lord shut him in.\n\nThe flood continued for 40 days on the earth; the waters increased and lifted up the ark so that it rose above the earth. The waters surged and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. Then the waters surged even higher on the earth, and all the high mountains under the whole sky were covered. The mountains were covered as the waters surged above them more than 20 feet. Every creature perished\u2014those that crawl on the earth, birds, livestock, wildlife, and those that swarm on the earth, as well as all mankind. Everything with the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils\u2014everything on dry land died. He wiped out every living thing that was on the surface of the ground, from mankind to livestock, to creatures that crawl, to the birds of the sky, and they were wiped off the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark. And the waters surged on the earth 150 days."

    "Passage": "God remembered Noah, as well as all the wildlife and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water began to subside. The sources of the watery depths and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky stopped. The water steadily receded from the earth, and by the end of 150 days the waters had decreased significantly. The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.\n\nThe waters continued to recede until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible. After 40 days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made, and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth. Then he sent out a dove to see whether the water on the earth\u2019s surface had gone down, but the dove found no resting place for her foot. She returned to him in the ark because water covered the surface of the whole earth. He reached out and brought her into the ark to himself. So Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove from the ark again. When the dove came to him at evening, there was a plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah knew that the water on the earth\u2019s surface had gone down. After he had waited another seven days, he sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again. In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the water that had covered the earth was dried up. Then Noah removed the ark\u2019s cover and saw that the surface of the ground was drying. By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was dry.\n\nThen God spoke to Noah, \u201cCome out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons\u2019 wives with you. Bring out all the living creatures that are with you\u2014birds, livestock, those that crawl on the ground\u2014and they will spread over the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.\u201d So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons\u2019 wives, came out. All wildlife, all livestock, every bird, and every creature that crawls on the earth came out of the ark by their groups.\n\nThen Noah built an altar to the Lord. He took some of every kind of clean animal and every kind of clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. When the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma, He said to Himself, \u201cI will never again curse the ground because of man, even though man\u2019s inclination is evil from his youth. And I will never again strike down every living thing as I have done.\n\nAs long as the earth endures,\nseedtime and harvest, cold and heat,\nsummer and winter, and day and night\nwill not cease.\u201d"

Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran.

When they came to the land of Canaan, Abram passed through the land to the site of Shechem, at the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.

I will keep My covenant between Me and you, and your future offspring throughout their generations, as an everlasting covenant to be your God and the God of your offspring after you. And to you and your future offspring I will give the land where you are residing\u2014all the land of Canaan\u2014as an eternal possession, and I will be their God.\u201d\n\nGod also said to Abraham, \u201cAs for you, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations are to keep My covenant. This is My covenant, which you are to keep, between Me and you and your offspring after you: Every one of your males must be circumcised. You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between Me and you. Throughout your generations, every male among you at eight days old is to be circumcised. This includes a slave born in your house and one purchased with money from any foreigner. The one who is not your offspring, a slave born in your house, as well as one purchased with money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be marked in your flesh as an everlasting covenant. If any male is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that man will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.\u201d"

    "Passage": "The Lord came to Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what He had promised. Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time God had told him. Abraham named his son who was born to him\u2014the one Sarah bore to him\u2014Isaac. When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him. Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born to him.\n\nSarah said, \u201cGod has made me laugh, and everyone who hears will laugh with me.\u201d She also said, \u201cWho would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son for him in his old age.\u201d\n\nThe child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. But Sarah saw the son mocking\u2014the one Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham. So she said to Abraham, \u201cDrive out this slave with her son, for the son of this slave will not be a coheir with my son Isaac!\u201d\n\nNow this was a very difficult thing for Abraham because of his son. But God said to Abraham, \u201cDo not be concerned about the boy and your slave. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her, because your offspring will be traced through Isaac. But I will also make a nation of the slave\u2019s son because he is your offspring.\u201d\n\nEarly in the morning Abraham got up, took bread and a waterskin, put them on Hagar\u2019s shoulders, and sent her and the boy away. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beer-sheba. When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to watch the boy die!\u201d So as she sat nearby, she wept loudly.\n\nGod heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hagar? Don\u2019t be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy from the place where he is. Get up, help the boy up, and support him, for I will make him a great nation.\u201d Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the waterskin and gave the boy a drink. God was with the boy, and he grew; he settled in the wilderness and became an archer. He settled in the Wilderness of Paran, and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt."

He split wood for a burnt offering and set out to go to the place God had told him about. On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. Then Abraham said to his young men, \"Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship; then we’ll come back to you.\" Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac. In his hand he took the fire and the knife, and the two of them walked on together. Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, \"My father.\" And he replied, \"Here I am, my son.\" Isaac said, \"The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?\" Abraham answered, \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" Then the two of them walked on together. When they arrived at the place that God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" He replied, \"Here I am.\" Then he said, \"Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.\" Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. And Abraham named that place The Lord Will Provide, so today it is said, \"It will be provided on the Lord’s mountain.\" Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven and said, \"By myself I have sworn,\" this is the Lord’s declaration: \"Because you have done this thing and have not withheld your only son, I will indeed bless you and make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the city gates of their enemies. And all the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring because you have obeyed my command.\""

    "Passage": "Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. Then the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire within a bush. As Moses looked, he saw that the bush was on fire but was not consumed. So Moses thought: I must go over and look at this remarkable sight. Why isn\u2019t the bush burning up?\n\nWhen the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from the bush, \u201cMoses, Moses!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cDo not come closer,\u201d He said. \u201cRemove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.\u201d Then He continued, \u201cI am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\u201d Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.\n\nThen the Lord said, \u201cI have observed the misery of My people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I know about their sufferings. I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey\u2014the territory of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. The Israelites\u2019 cry for help has come to Me, and I have also seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. Therefore, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may lead My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.\u201d\n\nBut Moses asked God, \u201cWho am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?\u201d\n\nHe answered, \u201cI will certainly be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will all worship God at this mountain.\u201d\n\nThen Moses asked God, \u201cIf I go to the Israelites and say to them: The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, \u2018What is His name?\u2019 what should I tell them?\u201d\n\nGod replied to Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.\u201d God also said to Moses, \u201cSay this to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.\n\n\u201cGo and assemble the elders of Israel and say to them: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I have paid close attention to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt. And I have promised you that I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites\u2014a land flowing with milk and honey. They will listen to what you say. Then you, along with the elders of Israel, must go to the king of Egypt and say to him: Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.\n\n\u201cHowever, I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go, unless he is forced by a strong hand. I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles that I will perform in it. After that, he will let you go. And I will give these people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. Each woman will ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.\u201d"

Then He said, \u201cPut your hand back inside your cloak.\u201d He put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it had again become like the rest of his skin. \u201cIf they will not believe you and will not respond to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the second sign. And if they don\u2019t believe even these two signs or listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground.

    "Passage": "The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: \u201cThis month is to be the beginning of months for you; it is the first month of your year. Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they must each select an animal of the flock according to their fathers\u2019 households, one animal per household. If the household is too small for a whole animal, that person and the neighbor nearest his house are to select one based on the combined number of people; you should apportion the animal according to what each person will eat. You must have an unblemished animal, a year-old male; you may take it from either the sheep or the goats. You are to keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight. They must take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses where they eat them. They are to eat the meat that night; they should eat it, roasted over the fire along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or cooked in boiling water, but only roasted over fire\u2014its head as well as its legs and inner organs. Do not let any of it remain until morning; you must burn up any part of it that does remain before morning. Here is how you must eat it: you must be dressed for travel, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in a hurry; it is the Lord\u2019s Passover.\n\n\u201cI will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and strike every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. I am Yahweh; I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. The blood on the houses where you are staying will be a distinguishing mark for you; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will be among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.\n\n\u201cThis day is to be a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to the Lord. You are to celebrate it throughout your generations as a permanent statute. You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day you must remove yeast from your houses. Whoever eats what is leavened from the first day through the seventh day must be cut off from Israel. You are to hold a sacred assembly on the first day and another sacred assembly on the seventh day. No work may be done on those days except for preparing what people need to eat\u2014you may do only that.\n\n\u201cYou are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread because on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt. You must observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent statute. You are to eat unleavened bread in the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day of the month until the evening of the twenty-first day. Yeast must not be found in your houses for seven days. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether a foreign resident or native of the land, must be cut off from the community of Israel. Do not eat anything leavened; eat unleavened bread in all your homes.\u201d\n\nThen Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, \u201cGo, select an animal from the flock according to your families, and slaughter the Passover animal. Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and brush the lintel and the two doorposts with some of the blood in the basin. None of you may go out the door of his house until morning. When the Lord passes through to strike Egypt and sees the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, He will pass over the door and not let the destroyer enter your houses to strike you.\n\n\u201cKeep this command permanently as a statute for you and your descendants. When you enter the land that the Lord will give you as He promised, you are to observe this ritual. When your children ask you, \u2018What does this ritual mean to you?\u2019 you are to reply, \u2018It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, for He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians and spared our homes.\u2019\u201d So the people bowed down and worshiped. Then the Israelites went and did this; they did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.\n\nNow at midnight the Lord struck every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and every firstborn of the livestock. During the night Pharaoh got up, he along with all his officials and all the Egyptians, and there was a loud wailing throughout Egypt because there wasn\u2019t a house without someone dead."

In the course of time Cain presented some of the land\u2019s produce as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also presented an offering\u2014some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he looked despondent.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won\u2019t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.\u201d\n\nCain said to his brother Abel, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhere is your brother Abel?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s guardian?\u201d\n\nThen He said, \u201cWhat have you done?

Pharaoh will say of the Israelites: They are wandering around the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in. I will harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart so that he will pursue them. Then I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh.\u201d So the Israelites did this.\n\nWhen the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about the people and said: \u201cWhat have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.\u201d So he got his chariot ready and took his troops with him; he took 600 of the best chariots and all the rest of the chariots of Egypt, with officers in each one. The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the Israelites, who were going out triumphantly. The Egyptians\u2014all Pharaoh\u2019s horses and chariots, his horsemen, and his army\u2014chased after them and caught up with them as they camped by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.\n\nAs Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians coming after them. Then the Israelites were terrified and cried out to the Lord for help. They said to Moses: \u201cIs it because there are no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? Isn\u2019t this what we told you in Egypt: Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.\u201d\n\nBut Moses said to the people, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Stand firm and see the Lord\u2019s salvation He will provide for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. The Lord will fight for you; you must be quiet.\u201d\n\nThe Lord said to Moses, \u201cWhy are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to break camp. As for you, lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. I am going to harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them, and I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh, all his army, and his chariots and horsemen. The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I receive glory through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.\u201d\n\nThen the Angel of God, who was going in front of the Israelite forces, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and stood behind them. It came between the Egyptian and Israelite forces. The cloud was there in the darkness, yet it lit up the night. So neither group came near the other all night long.\n\nThen Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The Lord drove the sea back with a powerful east wind all that night and turned the sea into dry land. So the waters were divided, and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with the waters like a wall to them on their right and their left.\n\nThe Egyptians set out in pursuit\u2014all Pharaoh\u2019s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen\u2014and went into the sea after them. Then during the morning watch, the Lord looked down on the Egyptian forces from the pillar of fire and cloud, and threw them into confusion. He caused their chariot wheels to swerve and made them drive with difficulty. \u201cLet\u2019s get away from Israel,\u201d the Egyptians said, \u201cbecause Yahweh is fighting for them against Egypt!\u201d\n\nThen the Lord said to Moses, \u201cStretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back on the Egyptians, on their chariots and horsemen.\u201d So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal depth. While the Egyptians were trying to escape from it, the Lord threw them into the sea. The waters came back and covered the chariots and horsemen, the entire army of Pharaoh, that had gone after them into the sea. None of them survived.\n\nBut the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with the waters like a wall to them on their right and their left. That day the Lord saved Israel from the power of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. When Israel saw the great power that the Lord used against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord and believed in Him and in His servant Moses."

    "Passage": "In the third month, on the same day of the month that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai. After they departed from Rephidim, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain.\n\nMoses went up the mountain to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain: \u201cThis is what you must say to the house of Jacob, and explain to the Israelites: \u2018You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I carried you on eagles\u2019 wings and brought you to Me. Now if you will listen to Me and carefully keep My covenant, you will be My own possession out of all the peoples, although all the earth is Mine, and you will be My kingdom of priests and My holy nation.\u2019 These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites.\u201d\n\nAfter Moses came back, he summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. Then all the people responded together, \u201cWe will do all that the Lord has spoken.\u201d So Moses brought the people\u2019s words back to the Lord.\n\nThe Lord said to Moses, \u201cI am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you and will always believe you.\u201d Then Moses reported the people\u2019s words to the Lord. And the Lord told Moses, \u201cGo to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes and be prepared by the third day, for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. Put boundaries for the people all around the mountain and say: Be careful that you don\u2019t go up on the mountain or touch its base. Anyone who touches the mountain will be put to death. No hand may touch him; instead he will be stoned or shot with arrows. No animal or man will live. When the ram\u2019s horn sounds a long blast, they may go up the mountain.\u201d\n\nThen Moses came down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. He said to the people, \u201cBe prepared by the third day. Do not have sexual relations with women.\u201d\n\nOn the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a loud trumpet sound, so that all the people in the camp shuddered. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the Lord came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.\n\nThe Lord came down on Mount Sinai at the top of the mountain. Then the Lord summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and he went up. The Lord directed Moses, \u201cGo down and warn the people not to break through to see the Lord; otherwise many of them will die. Even the priests who come near the Lord must purify themselves or the Lord will break out in anger against them.\u201d\n\nBut Moses responded to the Lord, \u201cThe people cannot come up Mount Sinai, since You warned us: Put a boundary around the mountain and consider it holy.\u201d And the Lord replied to him, \u201cGo down and come back with Aaron. But the priests and the people must not break through to come up to the Lord, or He will break out in anger against them.\u201d So Moses went down to the people and told them."

No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. I will be with you, just as I was with Moses.

The men pursued them along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as they left to pursue them, the gate was shut.\n\nBefore the men fell asleep, she went up on the roof and said to them, \u201cI know that the Lord has given you this land and that the terror of you has fallen on us, and everyone who lives in the land is panicking because of you. For we have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings you completely destroyed across the Jordan. When we heard this, we lost heart, and everyone\u2019s courage failed because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on earth below. Now please swear to me by the Lord that you will also show kindness to my family, because I showed kindness to you. Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and save us from death.\u201d\n\nThe men answered her, \u201cWe will give our lives for yours. If you don\u2019t report our mission, we will show kindness and faithfulness to you when the Lord gives us the land.\u201d\n\nThen she let them down by a rope through the window, since she lived in a house that was built into the wall of the city. \u201cGo to the hill country so that the men pursuing you won\u2019t find you,\u201d she said to them. \u201cHide yourselves there for three days until they return; afterward, go on your way.\u201d\n\nThe men said to her, \u201cWe will be free from this oath you made us swear, unless, when we enter the land, you tie this scarlet cord to the window through which you let us down. Bring your father, mother, brothers, and all your father\u2019s family into your house. If anyone goes out the doors of your house, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if anyone with you in the house should be harmed, his blood will be on our heads.

After they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord to the window.\n\nSo the two men went into the hill country and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. They searched all along the way, but did not find them. Then the men returned, came down from the hill country, and crossed the Jordan. They went to Joshua son of Nun and reported everything that had happened to them. They told Joshua, \u201cThe Lord has handed over the entire land to us.

After three days the officers went through the camp and commanded the people: \u201cWhen you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God carried by the Levitical priests, you must break camp and follow it. But keep a distance of about 1,000 yards between yourselves and the ark. Don\u2019t go near it, so that you can see the way to go, for you haven\u2019t traveled this way before.\u201d\n\nJoshua told the people, \u201cConsecrate yourselves, because the Lord will do wonders among you tomorrow.\u201d Then he said to the priests, \u201cTake the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people.\u201d So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them.\n\nThe Lord spoke to Joshua: \u201cToday I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they will know that I will be with you just as I was with Moses. Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: When you reach the edge of the waters, stand in the Jordan.\u201d\n\nThen Joshua told the Israelites, \u201cCome closer and listen to the words of the Lord your God.\u201d He said: \u201cYou will know that the living God is among you and that He will certainly dispossess before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites when the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth goes ahead of you into the Jordan. Now choose 12 men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe. When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the Jordan\u2019s waters, its waters will be cut off. The water flowing downstream will stand up in a mass.\u201d\n\nWhen the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of the people. Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan, their feet touched the water at its edge and the water flowing downstream stood still, rising up in a mass that extended as far as Adam, a city next to Zarethan. The water flowing downstream into the Sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea) was completely cut off, and the people crossed opposite Jericho. The priests carrying the ark of the Lord\u2019s covenant stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed on dry ground until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan."

Each of you lift a stone onto his shoulder, one for each of the Israelite tribes, so that this will be a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, \u2018What do these stones mean to you?\u2019 you should tell them, \u2018The waters of the Jordan were cut off in front of the ark of the Lord\u2019s covenant. When it crossed the Jordan, the Jordan\u2019s waters were cut off.\u2019 Therefore these stones will always be a memorial for the Israelites.\u201d\n\nThe Israelites did just as Joshua had commanded them. The 12 men took stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each of the Israelite tribes, just as the Lord had told Joshua. They carried them to the camp and set them down there. Joshua also set up 12 stones in the middle of the Jordan where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing. The stones are there to this day.\n\nThe priests carrying the ark continued standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people, in keeping with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people hurried across, and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the Lord crossed in the sight of the people. The Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh went in battle formation in front of the Israelites, as Moses had instructed them. About 40,000 equipped for war crossed to the plains of Jericho in the Lord\u2019s presence.\n\nOn that day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him throughout his life, as they had revered Moses. The Lord told Joshua, \u201cCommand the priests who carry the ark of the testimony to come up from the Jordan.\u201d\n\nSo Joshua commanded the priests, \u201cCome up from the Jordan.\u201d When the priests carrying the ark of the Lord\u2019s covenant came up from the middle of the Jordan, and their feet stepped out on solid ground, the waters of the Jordan resumed their course, flowing over all the banks as before.\n\nThe people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and camped at Gilgal on the eastern limits of Jericho. Then Joshua set up in Gilgal the 12 stones they had taken from the Jordan, and he said to the Israelites, \u201cIn the future, when your children ask their fathers, \u2018What is the meaning of these stones?\u2019 you should tell your children, \u2018Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.\u2019 For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over.

This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males\u2014all the men of war\u2014had died in the wilderness along the way after they had come out of Egypt. Though all the people who came out were circumcised, none of the people born in the wilderness along the way were circumcised after they had come out of Egypt. For the Israelites wandered in the wilderness 40 years until all the nation\u2019s men of war who came out of Egypt had died off because they did not obey the Lord. So the Lord vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. Joshua raised up their sons in their place; it was these he circumcised. They were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way. After the entire nation had been circumcised, they stayed where they were in the camp until they recovered. The Lord then said to Joshua, \u201cToday I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.\u201d Therefore, that place is called Gilgal to this day.\n\nWhile the Israelites camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month. The day after Passover they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land. And the day after they ate from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. Since there was no more manna for the Israelites, they ate from the crops of the land of Canaan that year.\n\nWhen Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand. Joshua approached Him and asked, \u201cAre You for us or for our enemies?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither,\u201d He replied. \u201cI have now come as commander of the Lord\u2019s army.\u201d\n\nThen Joshua bowed with his face to the ground in worship and asked Him, \u201cWhat does my Lord want to say to His servant?\u201d\n\nThe commander of the Lord\u2019s army said to Joshua, \u201cRemove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.\u201d And Joshua did so."

The Lord said to Joshua, \u201cLook, I have handed Jericho, its king, and its fighting men over to you. March around the city with all the men of war, circling the city one time. Do this for six days. Have seven priests carry seven ram\u2019s-horn trumpets in front of the ark. But on the seventh day, march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the trumpets. When there is a prolonged blast of the horn and you hear its sound, have all the people give a mighty shout. Then the city wall will collapse, and the people will advance, each man straight ahead.\u201d\n\nSo Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, \u201cTake up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven trumpets in front of the ark of the Lord.\u201d He said to the people, \u201cMove forward, march around the city, and have the armed troops go ahead of the ark of the Lord.\u201d\n\nAfter Joshua had spoken to the people, seven priests carrying seven trumpets before the Lord moved forward and blew the trumpets; the ark of the Lord\u2019s covenant followed them. While the trumpets were blowing, the armed troops went in front of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard went behind the ark. But Joshua had commanded the people: \u201cDo not shout or let your voice be heard. Don\u2019t let one word come out of your mouth until the time I say, \u2018Shout!\u2019 Then you are to shout.\u201d So the ark of the Lord was carried around the city, circling it once. They returned to the camp and spent the night there.\n\nJoshua got up early the next morning. The priests took the ark of the Lord, and the seven priests carrying seven trumpets marched in front of the ark of the Lord. While the trumpets were blowing, the armed troops went in front of them, and the rear guard went behind the ark of the Lord. On the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.\n\nEarly on the seventh day, they started at dawn and marched around the city seven times in the same way. That was the only day they marched around the city seven times. After the seventh time, the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, \u201cShout! For the Lord has given you the city. But the city and everything in it are set apart to the Lord for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone with her in the house will live, because she hid the men we sent. But keep yourselves from the things set apart, or you will be set apart for destruction. If you take any of those things, you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction and bring disaster on it. For all the silver and gold, and the articles of bronze and iron, are dedicated to the Lord and must go into the Lord\u2019s treasury.\u201d\n\nSo the people shouted, and the trumpets sounded. When they heard the blast of the trumpet, the people gave a great shout, and the wall collapsed. The people advanced into the city, each man straight ahead, and they captured the city. They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword\u2014every man and woman, both young and old, and every ox, sheep, and donkey.\n\nJoshua said to the two men who had scouted the land, \u201cGo to the prostitute\u2019s house and bring the woman out of there, and all who are with her, just as you promised her.\u201d So the young men who had scouted went in and brought out Rahab and her father, mother, brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel.\n\nThey burned up the city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the Lord\u2019s house. However, Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, her father\u2019s household, and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy on Jericho, and she lives in Israel to this day.\n\nAt that time Joshua imposed this curse:\n\nThe man who undertakes\nthe rebuilding of this city, Jericho,\nis cursed before the Lord.\nHe will lay its foundation\nat the cost of his firstborn;\nhe will set up its gates\nat the cost of his youngest.\nAnd the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land."

So Adoni-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed because Gibeon was a large city like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were warriors. Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, \u201cCome up and help me. We will attack Gibeon, because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.\u201d So the five Amorite kings\u2014the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon\u2014joined forces, advanced with all their armies, besieged Gibeon, and fought against it.\n\nThen the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: \u201cDon\u2019t abandon your servants. Come quickly and save us! Help us, for all the Amorite kings living in the hill country have joined forces against us.\u201d So Joshua and his whole military force, including all the fighting men, came from Gilgal.\n\nThe Lord said to Joshua, \u201cDo not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will be able to stand against you.\u201d\n\nSo Joshua caught them by surprise, after marching all night from Gilgal. The Lord threw them into confusion before Israel. He defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon, chased them through the ascent of Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah. As they fled before Israel, the Lord threw large hailstones on them from the sky along the descent of Beth-horon all the way to Azekah, and they died. More of them died from the hail than the Israelites killed with the sword.\n\nOn the day the Lord gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the Lord in the presence of Israel:\n\n\u201cSun, stand still over Gibeon,\nand moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.\u201d\nAnd the sun stood still\nand the moon stopped\nuntil the nation took vengeance on its enemies.\nIsn\u2019t this written in the Book of Jashar?\n\nSo the sun stopped\nin the middle of the sky\nand delayed its setting\nalmost a full day.\nThere has been no day like it before or since, when the Lord listened to the voice of a man, because the Lord fought for Israel.

Because of Midian, the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds. Whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and the Qedemites came and attacked them. They encamped against them and destroyed the produce of the land, even as far as Gaza. They left nothing for Israel to eat, as well as no sheep, ox or donkey. For the Midianites came with their cattle and their tents like a great swarm of locusts. They and their camels were without number, and they entered the land to waste it. So Israel became poverty-stricken because of Midian, and the Israelites cried out to the Lord.\n\nWhen the Israelites cried out to Him because of Midian, the Lord sent a prophet to them.

Do not fear the gods of the Amorites whose land you live in. But you did not obey Me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Angel of the Lord came, and He sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash, the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was threshing wheat in the wine vat in order to hide it from the Midianites. Then the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: \u201cThe Lord is with you, mighty warrior.\u201d\n\nGideon said to Him, \u201cPlease Sir, if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened? And where are all His wonders that our fathers told us about? They said, \u2018Hasn\u2019t the Lord brought us out of Egypt?\u2019 But now the Lord has abandoned us and handed us over to Midian.\u201d\n\nThe Lord turned to him and said, \u201cGo in the strength you have and deliver Israel from the power of Midian. Am I not sending you?\u201d\n\nHe said to Him, \u201cPlease, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father\u2019s house.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I will be with you,\u201d the Lord said to him. \u201cYou will strike Midian down as if it were one man.\u201d\n\nThen he said to Him, \u201cIf I have found favor in Your sight, give me a sign that You are speaking with me. Please do not leave this place until I return to You. Let me bring my gift and set it before You.\u201d\n\nAnd He said, \u201cI will stay until you return.\u201d\n\nSo Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from a half bushel of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. He brought them out and offered them to Him under the oak.\n\nThe Angel of God said to him, \u201cTake the meat with the unleavened bread, put it on this stone, and pour the broth on it.\u201d And he did so.\n\nThe Angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that was in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire came up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.\n\nWhen Gideon realized that He was the Angel of the Lord, he said, \u201cOh no, Lord God! I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!\u201d\n\nBut the Lord said to him, \u201cPeace to you. Don\u2019t be afraid, for you will not die.\u201d So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it Yahweh Shalom. It is in Ophrah of the Abiezrites until today."

    "Prayer Prompt": "Pray for the ability to see God\u2019s hand in your life, even during difficult seasons.",
    "Passage": "During the time of the judges, there was a famine in the land. A man left Bethlehem in Judah with his wife and two sons to live in the land of Moab for a while. The man\u2019s name was Elimelech, and his wife\u2019s name was Naomi. The names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They entered the land of Moab and settled there. Naomi\u2019s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons. Her sons took Moabite women as their wives: one was named Orpah and the second was named Ruth. After they lived in Moab about 10 years, both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two children and without her husband.\n\nShe and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab, because she had heard in Moab that the Lord had paid attention to His people\u2019s need by providing them food. She left the place where she had been living, accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, and traveled along the road leading back to the land of Judah.\n\nShe said to them, \u201cEach of you go back to your mother\u2019s home. May the Lord show faithful love to you as you have shown to the dead and to me. May the Lord enable each of you to find security in the house of your new husband.\u201d She kissed them, and they wept loudly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d they said to her. \u201cWe will go with you to your people.\u201d\n\nBut Naomi replied, \u201cReturn home, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Am I able to have any more sons who could become your husbands? Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons, would you be willing to wait for them to grow up? Would you restrain yourselves from remarrying? No, my daughters, my life is much too bitter for you to share, because the Lord\u2019s hand has turned against me.\u201d Again they wept loudly, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. Naomi said, \u201cLook, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her god. Follow your sister-in-law.\u201d\n\nBut Ruth replied:\n\nDo not persuade me to leave you\nor go back and not follow you.\nFor wherever you go, I will go,\nand wherever you live, I will live;\nyour people will be my people,\nand your God will be my God.\nWhere you die, I will die,\nand there I will be buried.\nMay Yahweh punish me,\nand do so severely,\nif anything but death separates you and me.\nWhen Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to persuade her.\n\nThe two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about their arrival and the local women exclaimed, \u201cCan this be Naomi?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,\u201d she answered, \u201cfor the Almighty has made me very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the Lord has pronounced judgment on me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?\u201d\n\nSo Naomi came back from the land of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest."

    "Passage": "Now Naomi had a relative on her husband\u2019s side named Boaz. He was a prominent man of noble character from Elimelech\u2019s family.\n\nRuth the Moabitess asked Naomi, \u201cWill you let me go into the fields and gather fallen grain behind someone who allows me to?\u201d\n\nNaomi answered her, \u201cGo ahead, my daughter.\u201d So Ruth left and entered the field to gather grain behind the harvesters. She happened to be in the portion of land belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech\u2019s family.\n\nLater, when Boaz arrived from Bethlehem, he said to the harvesters, \u201cThe Lord be with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lord bless you,\u201d they replied.\n\nBoaz asked his servant who was in charge of the harvesters, \u201cWhose young woman is this?\u201d\n\nThe servant answered, \u201cShe is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab. She asked, \u2018Will you let me gather fallen grain among the bundles behind the harvesters?\u2019 She came and has remained from early morning until now, except that she rested a little in the shelter.\u201d\n\nThen Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cListen, my daughter. Don\u2019t go and gather grain in another field, and don\u2019t leave this one, but stay here close to my female servants. See which field they are harvesting, and follow them. Haven\u2019t I ordered the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled.\u201d\n\nShe bowed with her face to the ground and said to him, \u201cWhy are you so kind to notice me, although I am a foreigner?\u201d\n\nBoaz answered her, \u201cEverything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband\u2019s death has been fully reported to me: how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and how you came to a people you didn\u2019t previously know. May the Lord reward you for what you have done, and may you receive a full reward from the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have been so kind to me, for you have comforted and encouraged your slave, although I am not like one of your female servants.\u201d\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won\u2019t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.\u201d\n\nCain said to his brother Abel, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhere is your brother Abel?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s guardian?\u201d\n\nThen He said, \u201cWhat have you done? Your brother\u2019s blood cries out to Me from the ground! So now you are cursed, alienated, from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother\u2019s blood you have shed. If you work the ground, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\u201d\n\nBut Cain answered the Lord, \u201cMy punishment is too great to bear! Since You are banishing me today from the soil, and I must hide myself from Your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord replied to him, \u201cIn that case, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.\u201d And He placed a mark on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him. Then Cain went out from the Lord\u2019s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."

She ate and was satisfied and had some left over.\n\nWhen she got up to gather grain, Boaz ordered his young men, \u201cLet her even gather grain among the bundles, and don\u2019t humiliate her. Pull out some stalks from the bundles for her and leave them for her to gather. Don\u2019t rebuke her.\u201d So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening.

Then she brought out what she had left over from her meal and gave it to her.\n\nThen her mother-in-law said to her, \u201cWhere did you gather barley today, and where did you work?

Haven\u2019t you been working with his female servants? This evening he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor. Wash, put on perfumed oil, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but don\u2019t let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. When he lies down, notice the place where he\u2019s lying, go in and uncover his feet, and lie down. Then he will explain to you what you should do.\u201d\n\nSo Ruth said to her, \u201cI will do everything you say.\u201d She went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her. After Boaz ate, drank, and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the pile of barley. Then she went in secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.\n\nAt midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman! So he asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Ruth, your slave,\u201d she replied. \u201cSpread your cloak over me, for you are a family redeemer.\u201d\n\nThen he said, \u201cMay the Lord bless you, my daughter. You have shown more kindness now than before, because you have not pursued younger men, whether rich or poor. Now don\u2019t be afraid, my daughter. I will do for you whatever you say, since all the people in my town know that you are a woman of noble character. Yes, it is true that I am a family redeemer, but there is a redeemer closer than I am. Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, that\u2019s good. Let him redeem you. But if he doesn\u2019t want to redeem you, as the Lord lives, I will. Now lie down until morning.\u201d\n\nSo she lay down at his feet until morning but got up while it was still dark.

Then Boaz took 10 men of the town\u2019s elders and said, \u201cSit here.\u201d And they sat down. He said to the redeemer, \u201cNaomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling a piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech. I thought I should inform you: Buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you do not want to redeem it, tell me so that I will know, because there isn\u2019t anyone other than you to redeem it, and I am next after you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to redeem it,\u201d he answered.\n\nThen Boaz said, \u201cOn the day you buy the land from Naomi, you will also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased man, to perpetuate the man\u2019s name on his property.\u201d\n\nThe redeemer replied, \u201cI can\u2019t redeem it myself, or I will ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I can\u2019t redeem it.\u201d\n\nAt an earlier period in Israel, a man removed his sandal and gave it to the other party in order to make any matter legally binding concerning the right of redemption or the exchange of property. This was the method of legally binding a transaction in Israel.\n\nSo the redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, \u201cBuy back the property yourself.\u201d\n\nBoaz said to the elders and all the people, \u201cYou are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.

However, his sons did not walk in his ways\u2014they turned toward dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.\n\nSo all the elders of Israel gathered together and went to Samuel at Ramah.

Therefore, appoint a king to judge us the same as all the other nations have.\u201d\n\nWhen they said, \u201cGive us a king to judge us,\u201d Samuel considered their demand sinful, so he prayed to the Lord. But the Lord told him, \u201cListen to the people and everything they say to you. They have not rejected you; they have rejected Me as their king. They are doing the same thing to you that they have done to Me, since the day I brought them out of Egypt until this day, abandoning Me and worshiping other gods.

He said, \u201cThese are the rights of the king who will rule over you: He will take your sons and put them to his use in his chariots, on his horses, or running in front of his chariots. He can appoint them for his use as commanders of thousands or commanders of fifties, to plow his ground or reap his harvest, or to make his weapons of war or the equipment for his chariots. He can take your daughters to become perfumers, cooks, and bakers. He can take your best fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his servants. He can take a tenth of your grain and your vineyards and give them to his officials and servants. He can take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys and use them for his work. He can take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves can become his servants. When that day comes, you will cry out because of the king you\u2019ve chosen for yourselves, but the Lord won\u2019t answer you on that day.\u201d\n\nThe people refused to listen to Samuel. \u201cNo!\u201d they said. \u201cWe must have a king over us.

There was no one more impressive among the Israelites than he. He stood a head taller than anyone else.\n\nOne day the donkeys of Saul\u2019s father Kish wandered off. Kish said to his son Saul, \u201cTake one of the attendants with you and go look for the donkeys.\u201d Saul and his attendant went through the hill country of Ephraim and then through the region of Shalishah, but they didn\u2019t find them. They went through the region of Shaalim\u2014nothing. Then they went through the Benjaminite region but still didn\u2019t find them.\n\nWhen they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the attendant who was with him, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d the attendant said, \u201cthere\u2019s a man of God in this city who is highly respected; everything he says is sure to come true. Let\u2019s go there now. Maybe he\u2019ll tell us which way we should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose we do go,\u201d Saul said to his attendant, \u201cwhat do we take the man? The food from our packs is gone, and there\u2019s no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?\u201d\n\nThe attendant answered Saul: \u201cHere, I have a piece of silver. I\u2019ll give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.\u201d\n\nFormerly in Israel, a man who was going to inquire of God would say, \u201cCome, let\u2019s go to the seer,\u201d for the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Saul replied to his attendant. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d So they went to the city where the man of God was. As they were climbing the hill to the city, they found some young women coming out to draw water and asked, \u201cIs the seer here?\u201d\n\nThe women answered, \u201cYes, he is ahead of you. Hurry, he just now came to the city, because there\u2019s a sacrifice for the people at the high place today. If you go quickly, you can catch up with him before he goes to the high place to eat. The people won\u2019t eat until he comes because he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests can eat. Go up immediately\u2014you can find him now.\u201d So they went up toward the city.\n\nSaul and his attendant were entering the city when they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way to the high place. Now the day before Saul\u2019s arrival, the Lord had informed Samuel, \u201cAt this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over My people Israel. He will save them from the hand of the Philistines because I have seen the affliction of My people, for their cry has come to Me.\u201d When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord told him, \u201cHere is the man I told you about; he will rule over My people.\u201d\n\nSaul approached Samuel in the gate area and asked, \u201cWould you please tell me where the seer\u2019s house is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the seer,\u201d Samuel answered. \u201cGo up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me today. When I send you off in the morning, I\u2019ll tell you everything that\u2019s in your heart. As for the donkeys that wandered away from you three days ago, don\u2019t worry about them because they\u2019ve been found. And who does all Israel desire but you and all your father\u2019s family?\u201d\n\nSaul responded, \u201cAm I not a Benjaminite from the smallest of Israel\u2019s tribes and isn\u2019t my clan the least important of all the clans of the Benjaminite tribe? So why have you said something like this to me?\u201d\n\nSamuel took Saul and his attendant, brought them to the banquet hall, and gave them a place at the head of the 30 or so men who had been invited. Then Samuel said to the cook, \u201cGet the portion of meat that I gave you and told you to set aside.\u201d\n\nThe cook picked up the thigh and what was attached to it and set it before Saul. Then Samuel said, \u201cNotice that the reserved piece is set before you. Eat it because it was saved for you for this solemn event at the time I said, \u2018I\u2019ve invited the people.\u2019\u201d So Saul ate with Samuel that day. Afterward, they went down from the high place to the city, and Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof.\n\nThey got up early, and just before dawn, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, \u201cGet up, and I\u2019ll send you on your way!\u201d Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside. As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, \u201cTell the attendant to go on ahead of us, but you stay for a while, and I\u2019ll reveal the word of God to you.\u201d So the attendant went on.\n\nSamuel took the flask of oil, poured it out on Saul\u2019s head, kissed him, and said, \u201cHasn\u2019t the Lord anointed you ruler over His inheritance? Today when you leave me, you\u2019ll find two men at Rachel\u2019s Grave at Zelzah in the land of Benjamin. They will say to you, \u2018The donkeys you went looking for have been found, and now your father has stopped being concerned about the donkeys and is worried about you, asking: What should I do about my son?\u2019\n\n\u201cYou will proceed from there until you come to the oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one bringing three goats, one bringing three loaves of bread, and one bringing a skin of wine. They will ask how you are and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.\n\n\u201cAfter that you will come to the Hill of God where there are Philistine garrisons. When you arrive at the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place prophesying. They will be preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres. The Spirit of the Lord will control you, you will prophesy with them, and you will be transformed into a different person. When these signs have happened to you, do whatever your circumstances require because God is with you. Afterward, go ahead of me to Gilgal. I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice fellowship offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what to do.\u201d\n\nWhen Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God changed his heart, and all the signs came about that day. When Saul and his attendant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Then the Spirit of God took control of him, and he prophesied along with them.\n\nEveryone who knew him previously and saw him prophesy with the prophets asked each other, \u201cWhat has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\u201d\n\nThen a man who was from there asked, \u201cAnd who is their father?\u201d\n\nAs a result, \u201cIs Saul also among the prophets?\u201d became a popular saying. Then Saul finished prophesying and went to the high place.\n\nSaul\u2019s uncle asked him and his attendant, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo look for the donkeys,\u201d Saul answered. \u201cWhen we saw they weren\u2019t there, we went to Samuel.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Saul\u2019s uncle asked, \u201cwhat did Samuel say to you?\u201d\n\nSaul told him, \u201cHe assured us the donkeys had been found.\u201d However, Saul did not tell him what Samuel had said about the matter of kingship."

You said to Him, \u2018You must set a king over us.\u2019 Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans.\u201d\n\nSamuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected. Then he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans, and the Matrite clan was selected. Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected. But when they searched for him, they could not find him. They again inquired of the Lord, \u201cHas the man come here yet?\u201d\n\nThe Lord replied, \u201cThere he is, hidden among the supplies.\u201d\n\nThey ran and got him from there. When he stood among the people, he stood a head taller than anyone else. Samuel said to all the people, \u201cDo you see the one the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among the entire population.\u201d\n\nAnd all the people shouted, \u201cLong live the king!\u201d\n\nSamuel proclaimed to the people the rights of kingship. He wrote them on a scroll, which he placed in the presence of the Lord. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to his home.\n\nSaul also went to his home in Gibeah, and brave men whose hearts God had touched went with him. But some wicked men said, \u201cHow can this guy save us?\u201d They despised him and did not bring him a gift, but Saul said nothing."

    "Passage": "The Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh in Judah and camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim. Saul and the men of Israel gathered and camped in the Valley of Elah; then they lined up in battle formation to face the Philistines.\n\nThe Philistines were standing on one hill, and the Israelites were standing on another hill with a ravine between them. Then a champion named Goliath, from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was nine feet, nine inches tall and wore a bronze helmet and bronze scale armor that weighed 125 pounds. There was bronze armor on his shins, and a bronze sword was slung between his shoulders. His spear shaft was like a weaver\u2019s beam, and the iron point of his spear weighed 15 pounds. In addition, a shield-bearer was walking in front of him.\n\nHe stood and shouted to the Israelite battle formations: \u201cWhy do you come out to line up in battle formation?\u201d He asked them, \u201cAm I not a Philistine and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me. If he wins in a fight against me and kills me, we will be your servants. But if I win against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.\u201d Then the Philistine said, \u201cI defy the ranks of Israel today. Send me a man so we can fight each other!\u201d When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they lost their courage and were terrified.\n\nNow David was the son of the Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah named Jesse. Jesse had eight sons and during Saul\u2019s reign was already an old man. Jesse\u2019s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war, and their names were Eliab, the firstborn, Abinadab, the next, and Shammah, the third, and David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul, but David kept going back and forth from Saul to tend his father\u2019s flock in Bethlehem.\n\nEvery morning and evening for 40 days the Philistine came forward and took his stand. One day Jesse had told his son David: \u201cTake this half-bushel of roasted grain along with these 10 loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. Also take these 10 portions of cheese to the field commander. Check on the welfare of your brothers and bring a confirmation from them. They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.\u201d\n\nSo David got up early in the morning, left the flock with someone to keep it, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had instructed him.\n\nHe arrived at the perimeter of the camp as the army was marching out to its battle formation shouting their battle cry. Israel and the Philistines lined up in battle formation facing each other. David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were. While he was speaking with them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, came forward from the Philistine battle line and shouted his usual words, which David heard. When all the Israelite men saw Goliath, they retreated from him terrified.\n\nPreviously, an Israelite man had declared: \u201cDo you see this man who keeps coming out? He comes to defy Israel. The king will make the man who kills him very rich and will give him his daughter. The king will also make the household of that man\u2019s father exempt from paying taxes in Israel.\u201d\n\nDavid spoke to the men who were standing with him: \u201cWhat will be done for the man who kills that Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?\u201d\n\nThe people told him about the offer, concluding, \u201cThat is what will be done for the man who kills him.\u201d\n\nDavid\u2019s oldest brother Eliab listened as he spoke to the men, and became angry with him. \u201cWhy did you come down here?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho did you leave those few sheep with in the wilderness? I know your arrogance and your evil heart\u2014you came down to see the battle!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have I done now?\u201d protested David. \u201cIt was just a question.\u201d Then he turned from those beside him to others in front of him and asked about the offer. The people gave him the same answer as before."

    "Passage": "What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, so he had David brought to him. David said to Saul, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone be discouraged by him; your servant will go and fight this Philistine!\u201d\n\nBut Saul replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t go fight this Philistine. You\u2019re just a youth, and he\u2019s been a warrior since he was young.\u201d\n\nDavid answered Saul: \u201cYour servant has been tending his father\u2019s sheep. Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, I went after it, struck it down, and rescued the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.\u201d Then David said, \u201cThe Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.\u201d\n\nSaul said to David, \u201cGo, and may the Lord be with you.\u201d\n\nThen Saul had his own military clothes put on David. He put a bronze helmet on David\u2019s head and had him put on armor. David strapped his sword on over the military clothes and tried to walk, but he was not used to them. \u201cI can\u2019t walk in these,\u201d David said to Saul, \u201cI\u2019m not used to them.\u201d So David took them off. Instead, he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the wadi and put them in the pouch, in his shepherd\u2019s bag. Then, with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine.\n\nThe Philistine came closer and closer to David, with the shield-bearer in front of him. When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him because he was just a youth, healthy and handsome. He said to David, \u201cAm I a dog that you come against me with sticks?\u201d Then he cursed David by his gods. \u201cCome here,\u201d the Philistine called to David, \u201cand I\u2019ll give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts!\u201d\n\nDavid said to the Philistine: \u201cYou come against me with a dagger, spear, and sword, but I come against you in the name of Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel\u2019s armies\u2014you have defied Him. Today, the Lord will hand you over to me. Today, I\u2019ll strike you down, cut your head off, and give the corpses of the Philistine camp to the birds of the sky and the creatures of the earth. Then all the world will know that Israel has a God, and this whole assembly will know that it is not by sword or by spear that the Lord saves, for the battle is the Lord\u2019s. He will hand you over to us.\u201d\n\nWhen the Philistine started forward to attack him, David ran quickly to the battle line to meet the Philistine. David put his hand in the bag, took out a stone, slung it, and hit the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. David defeated the Philistine with a sling and a stone. Even though David had no sword, he struck down the Philistine and killed him."

The men of Israel and Judah rallied, shouting their battle cry, and chased the Philistines to the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. Philistine bodies were strewn all along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.\n\nWhen the Israelites returned from the pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps. David took Goliath\u2019s head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put Goliath\u2019s weapons in his own tent.\n\nWhen Saul had seen David going out to confront the Philistine, he asked Abner the commander of the army, \u201cWhose son is this youth, Abner?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy king, as surely as you live, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Abner replied.\n\nThe king said, \u201cFind out whose son this young man is!\u201d\n\nWhen David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine\u2019s head still in his hand.

From the roof he saw a woman bathing\u2014a very beautiful woman. So David sent someone to inquire about her, and he reported, \u201cThis is Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite.\u201d\n\nDavid sent messengers to get her, and when she came to him, he slept with her. Now she had just been purifying herself from her uncleanness. Afterward, she returned home. The woman conceived and sent word to inform David: \u201cI am pregnant.\u201d\n\nDavid sent orders to Joab: \u201cSend me Uriah the Hittite.\u201d So Joab sent Uriah to David.

Then he said to Uriah, \u201cGo down to your house and wash your feet.\u201d So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king followed him. But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with all his master\u2019s servants; he did not go down to his house.\n\nWhen it was reported to David, \u201cUriah didn\u2019t go home,\u201d David questioned Uriah, \u201cHaven\u2019t you just come from a journey? Why didn\u2019t you go home?\u201d\n\nUriah answered David, \u201cThe ark, Israel, and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and his soldiers are camping in the open field. How can I enter my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live and by your life, I will not do this!\u201d\n\n\u201cStay here today also,\u201d David said to Uriah, \u201cand tomorrow I will send you back.\u201d So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.

In the course of time Cain presented some of the land\u2019s produce as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also presented an offering\u2014some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he looked despondent.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won\u2019t you be accepted?

The rich man had a large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one small ewe lamb that he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up, living with him and his children. It shared his meager food and drank from his cup; it slept in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him. Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man could not bring himself to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man\u2019s lamb and prepared it for his guest.\n\nDavid was infuriated with the man and said to Nathan: \u201cAs the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die! Because he has done this thing and shown no pity, he must pay four lambs for that lamb.\u201d\n\nNathan replied to David, \u201cYou are the man! This is what the Lord God of Israel says: \u2018I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. I gave your master\u2019s house to you and your master\u2019s wives into your arms, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah, and if that was not enough, I would have given you even more. Why then have you despised the command of the Lord by doing what I consider evil? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife as your own wife\u2014you murdered him with the Ammonite\u2019s sword. Now therefore, the sword will never leave your house because you despised Me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own wife.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is what the Lord says, \u2018I am going to bring disaster on you from your own family: I will take your wives and give them to another before your very eyes, and he will sleep with them publicly. You acted in secret, but I will do this before all Israel and in broad daylight.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavid responded to Nathan, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord.\u201d\n\nThen Nathan replied to David, \u201cThe Lord has taken away your sin; you will not die. However, because you treated the Lord with such contempt in this matter, the son born to you will die.\u201d Then Nathan went home.\n\nThe Lord struck the baby that Uriah\u2019s wife had borne to David, and he became ill."

The elders of his house stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat anything with them.\n\nOn the seventh day the baby died. But David\u2019s servants were afraid to tell him the baby was dead. They said, \u201cLook, while the baby was alive, we spoke to him, and he wouldn\u2019t listen to us. So how can we tell him the baby is dead? He may do something desperate.\u201d\n\nWhen David saw that his servants were whispering to each other, he guessed that the baby was dead. So he asked his servants, \u201cIs the baby dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d they replied.\n\nThen David got up from the ground. He washed, anointed himself, changed his clothes, went to the Lord\u2019s house, and worshiped. Then he went home and requested something to eat. So they served him food, and he ate.\n\nHis servants asked him, \u201cWhat did you just do? While the baby was alive, you fasted and wept, but when he died, you got up and ate food.\u201d\n\nHe answered, \u201cWhile the baby was alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, \u2018Who knows? The Lord may be gracious to me and let him live.\u2019 But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I\u2019ll go to him, but he will never return to me.\u201d\n\nThen David comforted his wife Bathsheba; he went and slept with her. She gave birth to a son and named him Solomon. The Lord loved him, and He sent a message through Nathan the prophet, who named him Jedidiah, because of the Lord."

    "Passage": "Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt by marrying Pharaoh\u2019s daughter. Solomon brought her to live in the city of David until he finished building his palace, the Lord\u2019s temple, and the wall surrounding Jerusalem. However, the people were sacrificing on the high places, because until that time a temple for the Lord\u2019s name had not been built. Solomon loved the Lord by walking in the statutes of his father David, but he also sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.\n\nThe king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there because it was the most famous high place. He offered 1,000 burnt offerings on that altar. At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night. God said, \u201cAsk. What should I give you?\u201d\n\nAnd Solomon replied, \u201cYou have shown great and faithful love to Your servant, my father David, because he walked before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and integrity. You have continued this great and faithful love for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.\n\n\u201cLord my God, You have now made Your servant king in my father David\u2019s place. Yet I am just a youth with no experience in leadership. Your servant is among Your people You have chosen, a people too numerous to be numbered or counted. So give Your servant an obedient heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?\u201d\n\nNow it pleased the Lord that Solomon had requested this. So God said to him, \u201cBecause you have requested this and did not ask for long life or riches for yourself, or the death of your enemies, but you asked discernment for yourself to understand justice, I will therefore do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you before and never will be again. In addition, I will give you what you did not ask for: both riches and honor, so that no man in any kingdom will be your equal during your entire life. If you walk in My ways and keep My statutes and commands just as your father David did, I will give you a long life.\u201d\n\nThen Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He went to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord\u2019s covenant, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants."

No one else was with us in the house; just the two of us were there. During the night this woman\u2019s son died because she lay on him. She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was asleep. She laid him at her breast, and she put her dead son in my arms.

Solomon said, \u201cCut the living boy in two and give half to one and half to the other.\u201d\n\nThe woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she felt great compassion for her son. \u201cMy lord, give her the living baby,\u201d she said, \u201cbut please don\u2019t have him killed!\u201d\n\nBut the other one said, \u201cHe will not be mine or yours.

She is his mother.\u201d All Israel heard about the judgment the king had given, and they stood in awe of the king because they saw that God\u2019s wisdom was in him to carry out justice."

    "Passage": "At that time Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the tribal heads and the ancestral leaders of the Israelites before him at Jerusalem in order to bring the ark of the Lord\u2019s covenant from the city of David, that is Zion. So all the men of Israel were assembled in the presence of King Solomon in the seventh month, the month of Ethanim, at the festival.\n\nAll the elders of Israel came, and the priests picked up the ark. The priests and the Levites brought the ark of the Lord, the tent of meeting, and the holy utensils that were in the tent. King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel, who had gathered around him and were with him in front of the ark, were sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered, because there were so many. The priests brought the ark of the Lord\u2019s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the most holy place beneath the wings of the cherubim. For the cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim covered the ark and its poles from above. The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen from outside the sanctuary; they are there to this day. Nothing was in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites when they came out of the land of Egypt.\n\nWhen the priests came out of the holy place, the cloud filled the Lord\u2019s temple, and because of the cloud, the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple.\n\nThen Solomon said:\n\nThe Lord said that He would dwell in thick darkness.\nI have indeed built an exalted temple for You,\na place for Your dwelling forever.\nThe king turned around and blessed the entire congregation of Israel while they were standing. He said:\n\nMay the Lord God of Israel be praised!\nHe spoke directly to my father David,\nand He has fulfilled the promise by His power.\nHe said,\n\u201cSince the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt,\nI have not chosen a city to build a temple in\namong any of the tribes of Israel,\nso that My name would be there.\nBut I have chosen David to rule My people Israel.\u201d\nIt was in the desire of my father David\nto build a temple for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\nBut the Lord said to my father David,\n\u201cSince it was your desire to build a temple for My name,\nyou have done well to have this desire.\nYet you are not the one to build it;\ninstead, your son, your own offspring,\nwill build it for My name.\u201d\nThe Lord has fulfilled what He promised.\nI have taken the place of my father David,\nand I sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised.\nI have built the temple for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\nI have provided a place there for the ark,\nwhere the Lord\u2019s covenant is\nthat He made with our ancestors\nwhen He brought them out of the land of Egypt.\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won\u2019t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.\u201d\n\nCain said to his brother Abel, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhere is your brother Abel?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s guardian?\u201d\n\nThen He said, \u201cWhat have you done? Your brother\u2019s blood cries out to Me from the ground! So now you are cursed, alienated, from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother\u2019s blood you have shed. If you work the ground, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\u201d\n\nBut Cain answered the Lord, \u201cMy punishment is too great to bear! Since You are banishing me today from the soil, and I must hide myself from Your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord replied to him, \u201cIn that case, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.\u201d And He placed a mark on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him. Then Cain went out from the Lord\u2019s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."

    "Passage": "Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king. When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about it, for he was still in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon\u2019s presence, Jeroboam stayed in Egypt. They summoned him, and Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam: \u201cYour father made our yoke difficult. You, therefore, lighten your father\u2019s harsh service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.\u201d\n\nRehoboam replied, \u201cGo home for three days and then return to me.\u201d So the people left. Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, \u201cHow do you advise me to respond to these people?\u201d\n\nThey replied, \u201cToday if you will be a servant to these people and serve them, and if you respond to them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.\u201d\n\nBut he rejected the advice of the elders who had advised him and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and served him. He asked them, \u201cWhat message do you advise that we send back to these people who said to me, \u2018Lighten the yoke your father put on us\u2019?\u201d\n\nThen the young men who had grown up with him told him, \u201cThis is what you should say to these people who said to you, \u2018Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us!\u2019 This is what you should tell them: \u2018My little finger is thicker than my father\u2019s loins! Although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with barbed whips.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had ordered: \u201cReturn to me on the third day.\u201d Then the king answered the people harshly. He rejected the advice the elders had given him and spoke to them according to the young men\u2019s advice: \u201cMy father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with barbed whips.\u201d\n\nThe king did not listen to the people, because this turn of events came from the Lord to carry out His word, which the Lord had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. When all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered him:\n\nWhat portion do we have in David?\nWe have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.\nIsrael, return to your tents;\nDavid, now look after your own house!\nSo Israel went to their tents, but Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.\n\nThen King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to get into the chariot and flee to Jerusalem. Israel is in rebellion against the house of David until today.\n\nWhen all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. No one followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone. When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized 180,000 choice warriors from the entire house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon. But a revelation from God came to Shemaiah, the man of God: \u201cSay to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, \u2018This is what the Lord says: You are not to march up and fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you must return home, for I have done this.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo they listened to what the Lord said and went back as He had told them.\n\nJeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built Penuel. Jeroboam said to himself, \u201cThe way things are going now, the kingdom might return to the house of David. If these people regularly go to offer sacrifices in the Lord\u2019s temple in Jerusalem, the heart of these people will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will murder me and go back to the king of Judah.\u201d So the king sought advice.\n\nThen he made two golden calves, and he said to the people, \u201cGoing to Jerusalem is too difficult for you. Israel, here is your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt.\u201d He set up one in Bethel, and put the other in Dan. This led to sin; the people walked in procession before one of the calves all the way to Dan.\n\nJeroboam also built shrines on the high places and set up priests from every class of people who were not Levites. Jeroboam made a festival in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the festival in Judah. He offered sacrifices on the altar; he made this offering in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had set up. He also stationed the priests in Bethel for the high places he had set up. He offered sacrifices on the altar he had set up in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month. He chose this month on his own. He made a festival for the Israelites, offered sacrifices on the altar, and burned incense."

He did what was evil in the Lord\u2019s sight, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him.\n\nShalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute money. But the king of Assyria discovered Hoshea\u2019s conspiracy. He had sent envoys to So king of Egypt and had not paid tribute money to the king of Assyria as in previous years. Therefore the king of Assyria arrested him and put him in prison.

He deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah and by the Habor, Gozan\u2019s river, and in the cities of the Medes.\n\nThis disaster happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God who had brought them out of the land of Egypt from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt and because they had worshiped other gods. They had lived according to the customs of the nations that the Lord had dispossessed before the Israelites and the customs the kings of Israel had introduced. The Israelites secretly did what was not right against the Lord their God. They built high places in all their towns from watchtower to fortified city. They set up for themselves sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.

They served idols, although the Lord had told them, \u201cYou must not do this.\u201d Still, the Lord warned Israel and Judah through every prophet and every seer, saying, \u201cTurn from your evil ways and keep My commands and statutes according to all the law I commanded your ancestors and sent to you through My servants the prophets.\u201d\n\nBut they would not listen.

They rejected His statutes and His covenant He had made with their ancestors and the decrees He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and became worthless themselves, following the surrounding nations the Lord had commanded them not to imitate.\n\nThey abandoned all the commands of the Lord their God. They made cast images for themselves, two calves, and an Asherah pole. They worshiped the whole heavenly host and served Baal. They made their sons and daughters pass through the fire and practiced divination and interpreted omens. They devoted themselves to do what was evil in the Lord\u2019s sight and provoked Him.\n\nTherefore, the Lord was very angry with Israel, and He removed them from His presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained. Even Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced. So the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and handed them over to plunderers until He had banished them from His presence.\n\nWhen the Lord tore Israel from the house of David, Israel made Jeroboam son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam led Israel away from following the Lord and caused them to commit great sin. The Israelites persisted in all the sins that Jeroboam committed and did not turn away from them. Finally, the Lord removed Israel from His presence just as He had declared through all His servants the prophets. So Israel has been exiled to Assyria from their homeland until today.\n\nThen the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in place of the Israelites in the cities of Samaria. The settlers took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. When they first lived there, they did not fear Yahweh. So the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them. The settlers spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, \u201cThe nations that you have deported and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land. Therefore He has sent lions among them that are killing them because the people don\u2019t know the requirements of the God of the land.\u201d\n\nThen the king of Assyria issued a command: \u201cSend back one of the priests you deported. Have him go and live there so he can teach them the requirements of the God of the land.\u201d So one of the priests they had deported came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should fear Yahweh.\n\nBut the people of each nation were still making their own gods in the cities where they lived and putting them in the shrines of the high places that the people of Samaria had made. The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of the Sepharvaim. They feared the Lord, but they also appointed from their number priests to serve them in the shrines of the high places. They feared the Lord, but they also worshiped their own gods according to the custom of the nations where they had been deported from.\n\nThey are still practicing the former customs to this day. None of them fear the Lord or observe their statutes and ordinances, the law and commandments the Lord commanded the descendants of Jacob. He had renamed him Israel. The Lord made a covenant with them and commanded them, \u201cDo not fear other gods; do not bow down to them; do not serve them; do not sacrifice to them. Instead fear the Lord, who brought you from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. You are to bow down to Him, and you are to sacrifice to Him. You are to be careful always to observe the statutes, the ordinances, the law, and the commandments He wrote for you; do not fear other gods. Do not forget the covenant that I have made with you. Do not fear other gods, but fear the Lord your God, and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.\u201d\n\nHowever, they would not listen but continued practicing their former customs. These nations feared the Lord but also served their idols. Their children and grandchildren continue doing as their fathers did until today."

In the course of time Cain presented some of the land\u2019s produce as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also presented an offering\u2014some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he looked despondent.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won\u2019t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door.

Your brother\u2019s blood cries out to Me from the ground! So now you are cursed, alienated, from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother\u2019s blood you have shed. If you work the ground, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\u201d\n\nBut Cain answered the Lord, \u201cMy punishment is too great to bear! Since You are banishing me today from the soil, and I must hide myself from Your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord replied to him, \u201cIn that case, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.\u201d And He placed a mark on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him. Then Cain went out from the Lord\u2019s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."

This is what the Lord God says: Because the enemy has said about you, \u2018Good! The ancient heights have become our possession,\u2019 therefore, prophesy and say: This is what the Lord God says: Because they have made you desolate and have trampled you from every side, so that you became a possession for the rest of the nations and an object of people\u2019s gossip and slander, therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God.

Look! I am on your side; I will turn toward you, and you will be tilled and sown. I will fill you with people, with the whole house of Israel in its entirety. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. I will fill you with people and animals, and they will increase and be fruitful. I will make you inhabited as you once were and make you better off than you were before. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. I will cause people, My people Israel, to walk on you; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance.

Their behavior before Me was like menstrual impurity. So I poured out My wrath on them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols. I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered among the countries. I judged them according to their conduct and actions. When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said about them, \u2018These are the people of Yahweh, yet they had to leave His land in exile.\u2019 Then I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went.\n\n\u201cTherefore, say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord God says: It is not for your sake that I will act, house of Israel, but for My holy name, which you profaned among the nations where you went.

I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place My Spirit within you and cause you to follow My statutes and carefully observe My ordinances. Then you will live in the land that I gave your fathers; you will be My people, and I will be your God."

    "Passage": "In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it. The Lord handed Jehoiakim king of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels from the house of God. Nebuchadnezzar carried them to the land of Babylon, to the house of his god, and put the vessels in the treasury of his god.\n\nThe king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family and from the nobility\u2014 young men without any physical defect, good-looking, suitable for instruction in all wisdom, knowledgeable, perceptive, and capable of serving in the king\u2019s palace\u2014and to teach them the Chaldean language and literature. The king assigned them daily provisions from the royal food and from the wine that he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to serve in the king\u2019s court. Among them, from the descendants of Judah, were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The chief official gave them other names: he gave the name Belteshazzar to Daniel, Shadrach to Hananiah, Meshach to Mishael, and Abednego to Azariah.\n\nDaniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king\u2019s food or with the wine he drank. So he asked permission from the chief official not to defile himself. God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official, yet he said to Daniel, \u201cMy lord the king assigned your food and drink. I\u2019m afraid of what would happen if he saw your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age. You would endanger my life with the king.\u201d\n\nSo Daniel said to the guard whom the chief official had assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, \u201cPlease test your servants for 10 days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then examine our appearance and the appearance of the young men who are eating the king\u2019s food, and deal with your servants based on what you see.\u201d He agreed with them about this and tested them for 10 days. At the end of 10 days they looked better and healthier than all the young men who were eating the king\u2019s food. So the guard continued to remove their food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.\n\nGod gave these four young men knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. Daniel also understood visions and dreams of every kind. At the end of the time that the king had said to present them, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. The king interviewed them, and among all of them, no one was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to serve in the king\u2019s court. In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them 10 times better than all the diviner-priests and mediums in his entire kingdom. Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus."

    "Passage": "King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue, 90 feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue the king had set up. Then they stood before the statue Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\n\nA herald loudly proclaimed, \u201cPeople of every nation and language, you are commanded: When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. But whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.\u201d\n\nTherefore, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and every kind of music, people of every nation and language fell down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\n\nSome Chaldeans took this occasion to come forward and maliciously accuse the Jews. They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, \u201cMay the king live forever. You as king have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music must fall down and worship the gold statue. Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire. There are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men have ignored you, the king; they do not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.\u201d\n\nThen in a furious rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king. Nebuchadnezzar asked them, \u201cShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don\u2019t serve my gods or worship the gold statue I have set up? Now if you\u2019re ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, fall down and worship the statue I made. But if you don\u2019t worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire\u2014and who is the god who can rescue you from my power?\u201d\n\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, \u201cNebuchadnezzar, we don\u2019t need to give you an answer to this question. If the God we serve exists, then He can rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and He can rescue us from the power of you, the king. But even if He does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up.\u201d\n\nThen Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than was customary, and he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. So these men, in their trousers, robes, head coverings, and other clothes, were tied up and thrown into the furnace of blazing fire. Since the king\u2019s command was so urgent and the furnace extremely hot, the raging flames killed those men who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego up. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.\n\nThen King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in alarm. He said to his advisers, \u201cDidn\u2019t we throw three men, bound, into the fire?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of course, Your Majesty,\u201d they replied to the king.\n\nHe exclaimed, \u201cLook! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed; and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.\u201d\n\nNebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and called: \u201cShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God\u2014come out!\u201d So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire. When the satraps, prefects, governors, and the king\u2019s advisers gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men: not a hair of their heads was singed, their robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them. Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, \u201cPraise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent His angel and rescued His servants who trusted in Him. They violated the king\u2019s command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. Therefore I issue a decree that anyone of any people, nation, or language who says anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb and his house made a garbage dump. For there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.\u201d Then the king rewarded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."

    "Passage": "Darius decided to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, stationed throughout the realm, and over them three administrators, including Daniel. These satraps would be accountable to them so that the king would not be defrauded. Daniel distinguished himself above the administrators and satraps because he had an extraordinary spirit, so the king planned to set him over the whole realm. The administrators and satraps, therefore, kept trying to find a charge against Daniel regarding the kingdom. But they could find no charge or corruption, for he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was found in him. Then these men said, \u201cWe will never find any charge against this Daniel unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.\u201d\n\nSo the administrators and satraps went together to the king and said to him, \u201cMay King Darius live forever. All the administrators of the kingdom, the prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors have agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an edict that for 30 days, anyone who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions\u2019 den. Therefore, Your Majesty, establish the edict and sign the document so that, as a law of the Medes and Persians, it is irrevocable and cannot be changed.\u201d So King Darius signed the document.\n\nWhen Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house. The windows in its upper room opened toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before. Then these men went as a group and found Daniel petitioning and imploring his God. So they approached the king and asked about his edict: \u201cDidn\u2019t you sign an edict that for 30 days any man who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions\u2019 den?\u201d\n\nThe king answered, \u201cAs a law of the Medes and Persians, the order stands and is irrevocable.\u201d\n\nThen they replied to the king, \u201cDaniel, one of the Judean exiles, has ignored you, the king, and the edict you signed, for he prays three times a day.\u201d As soon as the king heard this, he was very displeased; he set his mind on rescuing Daniel and made every effort until sundown to deliver him.\n\nThen these men went to the king and said to him, \u201cYou as king know it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or ordinance the king establishes can be changed.\u201d\n\nSo the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions\u2019 den. The king said to Daniel, \u201cMay your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!\u201d A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing in regard to Daniel could be changed. Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting. No diversions were brought to him, and he could not sleep.\n\nAt the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions\u2019 den. When he reached the den, he cried out in anguish to Daniel. \u201cDaniel, servant of the living God,\u201d the king said, \u201chas your God whom you serve continually been able to rescue you from the lions?\u201d\n\nThen Daniel spoke with the king: \u201cMay the king live forever. My God sent His angel and shut the lions\u2019 mouths. They haven\u2019t hurt me, for I was found innocent before Him. Also, I have not committed a crime against you my king.\u201d\n\nThe king was overjoyed and gave orders to take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, uninjured, for he trusted in his God. The king then gave the command, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions\u2019 den\u2014they, their children, and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\n\nThen King Darius wrote to those of every people, nation, and language who live in all the earth: \u201cMay your prosperity abound. I issue a decree that in all my royal dominion, people must tremble in fear before the God of Daniel:\n\nFor He is the living God,\nand He endures forever;\nHis kingdom will never be destroyed,\nand His dominion has no end.\nHe rescues and delivers;\nHe performs signs and wonders\nin the heavens and on the earth,\nfor He has rescued Daniel\nfrom the power of the lions.\u201d\nSo Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian."

When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about it\u2014for he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon\u2019s presence\u2014Jeroboam returned from Egypt. So they summoned him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam: \u201cYour father made our yoke difficult. Therefore, lighten your father\u2019s harsh service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.\u201d\n\nRehoboam replied, \u201cReturn to me in three days.\u201d So the people left.\n\nThen King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, \u201cHow do you advise me to respond to these people?\u201d\n\nThey replied, \u201cIf you will be kind to these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.\u201d\n\nBut he rejected the advice of the elders who had advised him, and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, the ones serving him. He asked them, \u201cWhat message do you advise we send back to these people who said to me, \u2018Lighten the yoke your father put on us\u2019?\u201d\n\nThen the young men who had grown up with him told him, \u201cThis is what you should say to the people who said to you, \u2018Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us!\u2019 This is what you should say to them: \u2018My little finger is thicker than my father\u2019s loins. Now therefore, my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I, with barbed whips.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered, saying, \u201cReturn to me on the third day.\u201d Then the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the elders\u2019 advice and spoke to them according to the young men\u2019s advice, saying, \u201cMy father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I, with barbed whips.\u201d\n\nThe king did not listen to the people because the turn of events came from God, in order that the Lord might carry out His word that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.\n\nWhen all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered the king:\n\nWhat portion do we have in David?\nWe have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.\nIsrael, each man to your tent;\nDavid, look after your own house now!\nSo all Israel went to their tents. But as for the Israelites living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\n\nThen King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. However, King Rehoboam managed to get into his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. Israel is in rebellion against the house of David until today."

Everything is futile.\u201d\nWhat does a man gain for all his efforts\nthat he labors at under the sun?\nA generation goes and a generation comes,\nbut the earth remains forever.\nThe sun rises and the sun sets;\npanting, it returns to its place\nwhere it rises.\nGusting to the south,\nturning to the north,\nturning, turning, goes the wind,\nand the wind returns in its cycles.\nAll the streams flow to the sea,\nyet the sea is never full.\nThe streams are flowing to the place,\nand they flow there again.\nAll things are wearisome;\nman is unable to speak.\nThe eye is not satisfied by seeing\nor the ear filled with hearing.\nWhat has been is what will be,\nand what has been done is what will be done;\nthere is nothing new under the sun.\nCan one say about anything,\n\u201cLook, this is new\u201d?\nIt has already existed in the ages before us.\nThere is no remembrance of those who came before;\nand of those who will come after\nthere will also be no remembrance\nby those who follow them.\nI, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. I applied my mind to seek and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven. God has given people this miserable task to keep them occupied. I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.\n\nWhat is crooked cannot be straightened;\nwhat is lacking cannot be counted.\nI said to myself, \u201cLook, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me, and my mind has thoroughly grasped wisdom and knowledge.\u201d I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind.\n\nFor with much wisdom is much sorrow;\nas knowledge increases, grief increases."

    "Reflective Question": "How does the pursuit of pleasure and wealth in Ecclesiastes challenge your understanding of lasting fulfillment?",
    "Prayer Prompt": "Pray for wisdom to find lasting joy and contentment in God, not in earthly pursuits.",
    "Passage": "I said to myself, \u201cGo ahead, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy what is good.\u201d But it turned out to be futile. I said about laughter, \u201cIt is madness,\u201d and about pleasure, \u201cWhat does this accomplish?\u201d I explored with my mind how to let my body enjoy life with wine and how to grasp folly\u2014my mind still guiding me with wisdom\u2014until I could see what is good for people to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.\n\nI increased my achievements. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself. I made gardens and parks for myself and planted every kind of fruit tree in them. I constructed reservoirs of water for myself from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees. I acquired male and female servants and had slaves who were born in my house. I also owned many herds of cattle and flocks, more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. I also amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I gathered male and female singers for myself, and many concubines, the delights of men. So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; my wisdom also remained with me. All that my eyes desired, I did not deny them. I did not refuse myself any pleasure, for I took pleasure in all my struggles. This was my reward for all my struggles. When I considered all that I had accomplished and what I had labored to achieve, I found everything to be futile and a pursuit of the wind. There was nothing to be gained under the sun.\n\nThen I turned to consider wisdom, madness, and folly, for what will the man be like who comes after the king? He will do what has already been done. And I realized that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, like the advantage of light over darkness.\n\nThe wise man has eyes in his head,\nbut the fool walks in darkness.\nYet I also knew that one fate comes to them both. So I said to myself, \u201cWhat happens to the fool will also happen to me. Why then have I been overly wise?\u201d And I said to myself that this is also futile. For, just like the fool, there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man, since in the days to come both will be forgotten. How is it that the wise man dies just like the fool? Therefore, I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.\n\nI hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave it to the man who comes after me. And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile. So I began to give myself over to despair concerning all my work that I had labored at under the sun. When there is a man whose work was done with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and he must give his portion to a man who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a great wrong. For what does a man get with all his work and all his efforts that he labors at under the sun? For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile.\n\nThere is nothing better for man than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work. I have seen that even this is from God\u2019s hand, because who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from Him? For to the man who is pleasing in His sight, He gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy, but to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and accumulating in order to give to the one who is pleasing in God\u2019s sight. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind."

I have seen the task that God has given people to keep them occupied. He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also put eternity in their hearts, but man cannot discover the work God has done from beginning to end. I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy the good life. It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts. I know that all God does will last forever; there is no adding to it or taking from it. God works so that people will be in awe of Him. Whatever is, has already been, and whatever will be, already is. God repeats what has passed.\n\nI also observed under the sun: there is wickedness at the place of judgment and there is wickedness at the place of righteousness. I said to myself, \u201cGod will judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every activity and every work.\u201d I said to myself, \u201cThis happens concerning people, so that God may test them and they may see for themselves that they are like animals.\u201d For the fate of people and the fate of animals is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; they all have the same breath. People have no advantage over animals since everything is futile. All are going to the same place; all come from dust, and all return to dust. Who knows if the spirit of people rises upward and the spirit of animals goes downward to the earth? I have seen that there is nothing better than for a person to enjoy his activities because that is his reward. For who can enable him to see what will happen after he dies?"

The Teacher sought to find delightful sayings and write words of truth accurately. The sayings of the wise are like goads, and those from masters of collections are like firmly embedded nails. The sayings are given by one Shepherd.\n\nBut beyond these, my son, be warned: there is no end to the making of many books, and much study wearies the body. When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is: fear God and keep His commands, because this is for all humanity.

    "Prayer Prompt": "Pray for the grace to trust God even in the midst of hardship and loss.",
    "Passage": "There was a man in the country of Uz named Job. He was a man of perfect integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil. He had seven sons and three daughters. His estate included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east.\n\nHis sons used to take turns having banquets at their homes. They would send an invitation to their three sisters to eat and drink with them. Whenever a round of banqueting was over, Job would send for his children and purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought: Perhaps my children have sinned, having cursed God in their hearts. This was Job\u2019s regular practice.\n\nOne day the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. The Lord asked Satan, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom roaming through the earth,\u201d Satan answered Him, \u201cand walking around on it.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord said to Satan, \u201cHave you considered My servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil.\u201d\n\nSatan answered the Lord, \u201cDoes Job fear God for nothing? Haven\u2019t You placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But stretch out Your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse You to Your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d the Lord told Satan, \u201ceverything he owns is in your power. However, you must not lay a hand on Job himself.\u201d So Satan left the Lord\u2019s presence.\n\nOne day when Job\u2019s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother\u2019s house, a messenger came to Job and reported: \u201cWhile the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby, the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d\n\nHe was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: \u201cA lightning storm struck from heaven. It burned up the sheep and the servants and devoured them, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d\n\nThat messenger was still speaking when yet another came and reported: \u201cThe Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d\n\nHe was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: \u201cYour sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother\u2019s house. Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d\n\nThen Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped, saying:\n\nNaked I came from my mother\u2019s womb,\nand naked I will leave this life.\nThe Lord gives, and the Lord takes away.\nPraise the name of Yahweh."

He still retains his integrity, even though you incited Me against him, to destroy him without just cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cSkin for skin!\u201d Satan answered the Lord. \u201cA man will give up everything he owns in exchange for his life. But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse You to Your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d the Lord told Satan, \u201che is in your power; only spare his life.\u201d So Satan left the Lord\u2019s presence and infected Job with terrible boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself while he sat among the ashes.\n\nHis wife said to him, \u201cDo you still retain your integrity? Curse God and die!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou speak as a foolish woman speaks,\u201d he told her. \u201cShould we accept only good from God and not adversity?\u201d Throughout all this Job did not sin in what he said.\n\nNow when Job\u2019s three friends\u2014Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite\u2014heard about all this adversity that had happened to him, each of them came from his home. They met together to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. When they looked from a distance, they could barely recognize him. They wept aloud, and each man tore his robe and threw dust into the air and on his head. Then they sat on the ground with him seven days and nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that his suffering was very intense."

For you have not spoken the truth about Me, as My servant Job has.\u201d Then Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord had told them, and the Lord accepted Job\u2019s prayer.\n\nAfter Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his prosperity and doubled his previous possessions. All his brothers, sisters, and former acquaintances came to his house and dined with him in his house. They sympathized with him and comforted him concerning all the adversity the Lord had brought on him. Each one gave him a qesitah and a gold earring.\n\nSo the Lord blessed the last part of Job\u2019s life more than the first. He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. He also had seven sons and three daughters. He named his first daughter Jemimah, his second Keziah, and his third Keren-happuch. No women as beautiful as Job\u2019s daughters could be found in all the land, and their father granted them an inheritance with their brothers.\n\nJob lived 140 years after this and saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. Then Job died, old and full of days.\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won\u2019t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.\u201d\n\nCain said to his brother Abel, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.\n\nThen the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhere is your brother Abel?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s guardian?\u201d\n\nThen He said, \u201cWhat have you done? Your brother\u2019s blood cries out to Me from the ground! So now you are cursed, alienated, from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother\u2019s blood you have shed. If you work the ground, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\u201d\n\nBut Cain answered the Lord, \u201cMy punishment is too great to bear! Since You are banishing me today from the soil, and I must hide myself from Your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord replied to him, \u201cIn that case, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.\u201d And He placed a mark on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him. Then Cain went out from the Lord\u2019s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."

Don\u2019t work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal of approval on Him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can we do to perform the works of God?\u201d they asked.\n\nJesus replied, \u201cThis is the work of God\u2014that you believe in the One He has sent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sign then are You going to do so we may see and believe You?\u201d they asked. \u201cWhat are You going to perform?

How can He now say, \u2018I have come down from heaven\u2019?\u201d\n\nJesus answered them, \u201cStop complaining among yourselves.

Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me\u2014 not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God.

If anyone walks during the night, he does stumble, because the light is not in him.\u201d He said this, and then He told them, \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I\u2019m on My way to wake him up.\u201d\n\nThen the disciples said to Him, \u201cLord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.\u201d\n\nJesus, however, was speaking about his death, but they thought He was speaking about natural sleep.

But Mary remained seated in the house.\n\nThen Martha said to Jesus, \u201cLord, if You had been here, my brother wouldn\u2019t have died. Yet even now I know that whatever You ask from God, God will give You.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour brother will rise again,\u201d Jesus told her.\n\nMartha said, \u201cI know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\u201d\n\nJesus said to her, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.

Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met Him. The Jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw that Mary got up quickly and went out. So they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to cry there.\n\nWhen Mary came to where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell at His feet and told Him, \u201cLord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died!\u201d\n\nWhen Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, He was angry in His spirit and deeply moved. \u201cWhere have you put him?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cLord,\u201d they told Him, \u201ccome and see.\u201d\n\nJesus wept.\n\nSo the Jews said, \u201cSee how He loved him!\u201d But some of them said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t He who opened the blind man\u2019s eyes also have kept this man from dying?\u201d\n\nThen Jesus, angry in Himself again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. \u201cRemove the stone,\u201d Jesus said.\n\nMartha, the dead man\u2019s sister, told Him, \u201cLord, he\u2019s already decaying.

Suddenly there was a violent earthquake, because an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and approached the tomb. He rolled back the stone and was sitting on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his robe was as white as snow. The guards were so shaken from fear of him that they became like dead men.\n\nBut the angel told the women, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, because I know you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here! For He has been resurrected, just as He said. Come and see the place where He lay. Then go quickly and tell His disciples, \u2018He has been raised from the dead. In fact, He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see Him there.\u2019 Listen, I have told you.\u201d\n\nSo, departing quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to tell His disciples the news.

Go and tell My brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see Me there.\u201d\n\nAs they were on their way, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. After the priests had assembled with the elders and agreed on a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money and told them, \u201cSay this, \u2018His disciples came during the night and stole Him while we were sleeping.\u2019 If this reaches the governor\u2019s ears, we will deal with him and keep you out of trouble.\u201d So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been spread among Jewish people to this day.\n\nThe 11 disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them. When they saw Him, they worshiped, but some doubted. Then Jesus came near and said to them, \u201cAll authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.

For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it\u2019s only nine in the morning. On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:\n\nAnd it will be in the last days, says God,\nthat I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity;\nthen your sons and your daughters will prophesy,\nyour young men will see visions,\nand your old men will dream dreams.\nI will even pour out My Spirit\non My male and female slaves in those days,\nand they will prophesy.\nI will display wonders in the heaven above\nand signs on the earth below:\nblood and fire and a cloud of smoke.\nThe sun will be turned to darkness\nand the moon to blood\nbefore the great and remarkable Day of the Lord comes.\nThen everyone who calls\non the name of the Lord will be saved.\n\u201cMen of Israel, listen to these words: This Jesus the Nazarene was a man pointed out to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you through Him, just as you yourselves know. Though He was delivered up according to God\u2019s determined plan and foreknowledge, you used lawless people to nail Him to a cross and kill Him. God raised Him up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it. For David says of Him:\n\nI saw the Lord ever before me;\nbecause He is at my right hand,\nI will not be shaken.\nTherefore my heart was glad,\nand my tongue rejoiced.\nMoreover, my flesh will rest in hope,\nbecause You will not leave me in Hades\nor allow Your Holy One to see decay.\nYou have revealed the paths of life to me;\nYou will fill me with gladness\nin Your presence.\n\u201cBrothers, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: He is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing this in advance, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah:\n\nHe was not left in Hades,\nand His flesh did not experience decay.\n\u201cGod has resurrected this Jesus. We are all witnesses of this. Therefore, since He has been exalted to the right hand of God and has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, He has poured out what you both see and hear. For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says:\n\nThe Lord declared to my Lord,\n\u2018Sit at My right hand\nuntil I make Your enemies Your footstool.\u2019\n\u201cTherefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah!\u201d\n\nWhen they heard this, they came under deep conviction and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: \u201cBrothers, what must we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cRepent,\u201d Peter said to them, \u201cand be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call.\u201d And with many other words he testified and strongly urged them, saying, \u201cBe saved from this corrupt generation!\u201d\n\nSo those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 people were added to them."

Then Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.

Barnabas, however, took him and brought him to the apostles and explained to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that He had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus. Saul was coming and going with them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. He conversed and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they attempted to kill him. When the brothers found out, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.\n\nSo the church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace, being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, and it increased in numbers."

Arriving in Salamis, they proclaimed God\u2019s message in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their assistant. When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God\u2019s message. But Elymas the sorcerer (this is the meaning of his name) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.\n\nThen Saul\u2014also called Paul\u2014filled with the Holy Spirit, stared straight at the sorcerer and said, \u201cYou son of the Devil, full of all deceit and all fraud, enemy of all righteousness!

    "Passage": "Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and went back to Jerusalem. They continued their journey from Perga and reached Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, \u201cBrothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people, you can speak.\u201d\n\nThen Paul stood up and motioned with his hand and said: \u201cMen of Israel, and you who fear God, listen! The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, exalted the people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and led them out of it with a mighty arm. And for about 40 years He put up with them in the wilderness; then after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave their land to them as an inheritance. This all took about 450 years. After this, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. Then they asked for a king, so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for 40 years. After removing him, He raised up David as their king and testified about him: \u2018I have found David the son of Jesse, a man loyal to Me, who will carry out all My will.\u2019\n\n\u201cFrom this man\u2019s descendants, according to the promise, God brought the Savior, Jesus, to Israel. Before He came to public attention, John had previously proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. Then as John was completing his life\u2019s work, he said, \u2018Who do you think I am? I am not the One. But look! Someone is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on His feet.\u2019\n\n\u201cBrothers, sons of Abraham\u2019s race, and those among you who fear God, the message of this salvation has been sent to us. For the residents of Jerusalem and their rulers, since they did not recognize Him or the voices of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled their words by condemning Him. Though they found no grounds for the death penalty, they asked Pilate to have Him killed. When they had fulfilled all that had been written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and put Him in a tomb. But God raised Him from the dead, and He appeared for many days to those who came with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people. And we ourselves proclaim to you the good news of the promise that was made to our ancestors. God has fulfilled this for us, their children, by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm:\n\nYou are My Son;\ntoday I have become Your Father.\nSince He raised Him from the dead, never to return to decay, He has spoken in this way, I will grant you the faithful covenant blessings made to David. Therefore He also says in another passage, You will not allow Your Holy One to see decay. For David, after serving his own generation in God\u2019s plan, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and decayed. But the One God raised up did not decay. Therefore, let it be known to you, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you, and everyone who believes in Him is justified from everything that you could not be justified from through the law of Moses. So beware that what is said in the prophets does not happen to you:\n\nLook, you scoffers,\nmarvel and vanish away,\nbecause I am doing a work in your days,\na work that you will never believe,\neven if someone were to explain it to you.\u201d\nAs they were leaving, the people begged that these matters be presented to them the following Sabbath. After the synagogue had been dismissed, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking with them and persuading them to continue in the grace of God.\n\nThe following Sabbath almost the whole town assembled to hear the message of the Lord. But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to oppose what Paul was saying by insulting him.\n\nThen Paul and Barnabas boldly said: \u201cIt was necessary that God\u2019s message be spoken to you first. But since you reject it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles! For this is what the Lord has commanded us:\n\nI have made you\na light for the Gentiles\nto bring salvation\nto the ends of the earth.\u201d\nWhen the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the message of the Lord, and all who had been appointed to eternal life believed. So the message of the Lord spread through the whole region. But the Jews incited the prominent women, who worshiped God, and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their district. But they shook the dust off their feet against them and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit."

When they had been sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, explaining in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and they created great joy among all the brothers.\n\nWhen they arrived at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them. But some of the believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, \u201cIt is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses!\u201d\n\nThen the apostles and the elders assembled to consider this matter. After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them: \u201cBrothers, you are aware that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the gospel message and believe. And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us. He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. Now then, why are you testing God by putting a yoke on the disciples\u2019 necks that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear? On the contrary, we believe we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way they are.\u201d\n\nThen the whole assembly fell silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they stopped speaking, James responded: \u201cBrothers, listen to me! Simeon has reported how God first intervened to take from the Gentiles a people for His name. And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:\n\nAfter these things I will return\nand rebuild David\u2019s fallen tent.\nI will rebuild its ruins\nand set it up again,\nso the rest of humanity\nmay seek the Lord\u2014\neven all the Gentiles\nwho are called by My name,\ndeclares the Lord who does these things,\nknown from long ago.\nTherefore, in my judgment, we should not cause difficulties for those among the Gentiles who turn to God, but instead we should write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from eating anything that has been strangled, and from blood. For since ancient times, Moses has had those who proclaim him in every city, and every Sabbath day he is read aloud in the synagogues.\u201d"

Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will personally report the same things by word of mouth. For it was the Holy Spirit\u2019s decision\u2014and ours\u2014to put no greater burden on you than these necessary things: that you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating anything that has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. You will do well if you keep yourselves from these things.\n\nFarewell.\n\nThen, being sent off, they went down to Antioch, and after gathering the assembly, they delivered the letter. When they read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. Both Judas and Silas, who were also prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers and strengthened them with a long message. After spending some time there, they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. But Paul and Barnabas, along with many others, remained in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the message of the Lord."

I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me; instead I went to Arabia and came back to Damascus.\n\nThen after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I stayed with him 15 days. But I didn\u2019t see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord\u2019s brother. Now I am not lying in what I write to you.

For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith working through love.\n\nYou were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth? This persuasion did not come from the One who called you. A little yeast leavens the whole lump of dough. I have confidence in the Lord you will not accept any other view. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty. Now brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.

    "Passage": "Therefore, no condemnation now exists for those in Christ Jesus, because the Spirit\u2019s law of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. What the law could not do since it was limited by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending His own Son in flesh like ours under sin\u2019s domain, and as a sin offering, in order that the law\u2019s requirement would be accomplished in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh think about the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, about the things of the Spirit. For the mind-set of the flesh is death, but the mind-set of the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind-set of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit itself to God\u2019s law, for it is unable to do so. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God lives in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then He who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through His Spirit who lives in you.\n\nSo then, brothers, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh, for if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. All those led by God\u2019s Spirit are God\u2019s sons. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, \u201cAbba, Father!\u201d The Spirit Himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God\u2019s children, and if children, also heirs\u2014heirs of God and coheirs with Christ\u2014seeing that we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him."

    "Passage": "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us. For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God\u2019s sons to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to futility\u2014not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it\u2014in the hope that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage of corruption into the glorious freedom of God\u2019s children. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now. And not only that, but we ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits\u2014we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. Now in this hope we were saved, yet hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience.\n\nIn the same way the Spirit also joins to help in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with unspoken groanings. And He who searches the hearts knows the Spirit\u2019s mind-set, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.\n\nWe know that all things work together for the good of those who love God: those who are called according to His purpose. For those He foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers.

    "Prayer Prompt": "Pray for a heart that desires to see all come to salvation and trust in God\u2019s sovereign will.",
    "Passage": "I speak the truth in Christ\u2014I am not lying; my conscience is testifying to me with the Holy Spirit\u2014 that I have intense sorrow and continual anguish in my heart. For I could almost wish to be cursed and cut off from the Messiah for the benefit of my brothers, my own flesh and blood. They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises. The ancestors are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Messiah, who is God over all, praised forever. Amen.\n\nBut it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Neither are they all children because they are Abraham\u2019s descendants. On the contrary, your offspring will be traced through Isaac. That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God\u2019s children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring. For this is the statement of the promise: At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son. And not only that, but also Rebekah received a promise when she became pregnant by one man, our ancestor Isaac. For though her sons had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God\u2019s purpose according to election might stand\u2014 not from works but from the One who calls\u2014she was told: The older will serve the younger. As it is written: I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.\n\nWhat should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! For He tells Moses:\n\nI will show mercy\nto whom I will show mercy,\nand I will have compassion\non whom I will have compassion.\nSo then it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. For the Scripture tells Pharaoh:\n\nI raised you up for this reason\nso that I may display My power in you\nand that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth.\nSo then, He shows mercy to those He wants to, and He hardens those He wants to harden.\n\nYou will say to me, therefore, \u201cWhy then does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?\u201d But who are you, a mere man, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, \u201cWhy did you make me like this?\u201d Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor? And what if God, desiring to display His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath ready for destruction? And what if He did this to make known the riches of His glory on objects of mercy that He prepared beforehand for glory\u2014 on us, the ones He also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? As He also says in Hosea:\n\nI will call Not My People, My People,\nand she who is Unloved, Beloved.\nAnd it will be in the place where they were told,\nyou are not My people,\nthere they will be called sons of the living God.\nBut Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:\n\nThough the number of Israel\u2019s sons\nis like the sand of the sea,\nonly the remnant will be saved;\nfor the Lord will execute His sentence\ncompletely and decisively on the earth.\nAnd just as Isaiah predicted:\n\nIf the Lord of Hosts had not left us offspring,\nwe would have become like Sodom,\nand we would have been made like Gomorrah.\nWhat should we say then? Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained righteousness\u2014namely the righteousness that comes from faith. But Israel, pursuing the law for righteousness, has not achieved the righteousness of the law. Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone. As it is written:\n\nLook! I am putting a stone in Zion to stumble over\nand a rock to trip over,\nyet the one who believes on Him\nwill not be put to shame."

Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.\n\nFor by the grace given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he should think. Instead, think sensibly, as God has distributed a measure of faith to each one. Now as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function, in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts:\n\nIf prophecy,\nuse it according to the standard of one\u2019s faith;\nif service, in service;\nif teaching, in teaching;\nif exhorting, in exhortation;\ngiving, with generosity;\nleading, with diligence;\nshowing mercy, with cheerfulness.\nLove must be without hypocrisy. Detest evil; cling to what is good. Show family affection to one another with brotherly love. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lack diligence; be fervent in spirit; serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope; be patient in affliction; be persistent in prayer. Share with the saints in their needs; pursue hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. Be in agreement with one another. Do not be proud; instead, associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own estimation. Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Try to do what is honorable in everyone\u2019s eyes. If possible, on your part, live at peace with everyone. Friends, do not avenge yourselves; instead, leave room for His wrath. For it is written: Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay, says the Lord. But\n\nIf your enemy is hungry, feed him.\nIf he is thirsty, give him something to drink.\nFor in so doing\nyou will be heaping fiery coals on his head.\nDo not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good."

    "Passage": "Therefore I, the prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk worthy of the calling you have received, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, accepting one another in love, diligently keeping the unity of the Spirit with the peace that binds us. There is one body and one Spirit\u2014just as you were called to one hope at your calling\u2014 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.\n\nNow grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of the Messiah\u2019s gift. For it says:\n\nWhen He ascended on high,\nHe took prisoners into captivity;\nHe gave gifts to people.\nBut what does \u201cHe ascended\u201d mean except that He descended to the lower parts of the earth? The One who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things. And He personally gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the training of the saints in the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ, until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God\u2019s Son, growing into a mature man with a stature measured by Christ\u2019s fullness. Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit. But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into Him who is the head\u2014Christ. From Him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building up itself in love by the proper working of each individual part."

    "Passage": "Therefore, I say this and testify in the Lord: You should no longer walk as the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their thoughts. They are darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and because of the hardness of their hearts. They became callous and gave themselves over to promiscuity for the practice of every kind of impurity with a desire for more and more.\n\nBut that is not how you learned about the Messiah, assuming you heard about Him and were taught by Him, because the truth is in Jesus. You took off your former way of life, the old self that is corrupted by deceitful desires; you are being renewed in the spirit of your minds; you put on the new self, the one created according to God\u2019s likeness in righteousness and purity of the truth.\n\nSince you put away lying, Speak the truth, each one to his neighbor, because we are members of one another. Be angry and do not sin. Don\u2019t let the sun go down on your anger, and don\u2019t give the Devil an opportunity. The thief must no longer steal. Instead, he must do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need. No foul language is to come from your mouth, but only what is good for building up someone in need, so that it gives grace to those who hear. And don\u2019t grieve God\u2019s Holy Spirit. You were sealed by Him for the day of redemption. All bitterness, anger and wrath, shouting and slander must be removed from you, along with all malice. And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave you in Christ."

    "Reflective Question": "How does the law differ from the promise of faith, and how does this affect your view of salvation?",
    "Prayer Prompt": "Pray for deeper understanding of the grace given through faith in Christ.",
    "Passage": "You foolish Galatians! Who has hypnotized you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified? I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now going to be made complete by the flesh? Did you suffer so much for nothing\u2014if in fact it was for nothing? So then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?\n\nJust as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness, then understand that those who have faith are Abraham\u2019s sons. Now the Scripture saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and told the good news ahead of time to Abraham, saying, All the nations will be blessed through you. So those who have faith are blessed with Abraham, who had faith.\n\nFor all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written: Everyone who does not continue doing everything written in the book of the law is cursed. Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous will live by faith. But the law is not based on faith; instead, the one who does these things will live by them. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written: Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed. The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles by Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promised Spirit through faith."

    "Prayer Prompt": "Pray for a deeper understanding of your identity as a child of God, through faith.",
    "Passage": "Brothers, I\u2019m using a human illustration. No one sets aside or makes additions to even a human covenant that has been ratified. Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say \u201cand to seeds,\u201d as though referring to many, but referring to one, and to your seed, who is Christ. And I say this: The law, which came 430 years later, does not revoke a covenant that was previously ratified by God and cancel the promise. For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.\n\nWhy then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise was made would come. The law was put into effect through angels by means of a mediator. Now a mediator is not for just one person, but God is one. Is the law therefore contrary to God\u2019s promises? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly be by the law. But the Scripture has imprisoned everything under sin\u2019s power, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. Before this faith came, we were confined under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed. The law, then, was our guardian until Christ, so that we could be justified by faith. But since that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.\n\nFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ like a garment. There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, heirs according to the promise."

Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have its approval. For government is God\u2019s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because it does not carry the sword for no reason. For government is God\u2019s servant, an avenger that brings wrath on the one who does wrong. Therefore, you must submit, not only because of wrath, but also because of your conscience. And for this reason you pay taxes, since the authorities are God\u2019s public servants, continually attending to these tasks.

Whatever is needed\u2014young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, or wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem\u2014let it be given to them every day without fail, so that they can offer sacrifices of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.\n\nI also issue a decree concerning any man who interferes with this directive:\n\nLet a beam be torn from his house and raised up; he will be impaled on it, and his house will be made into a garbage dump because of this offense. May the God who caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who dares to harm or interfere with this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued the decree. Let it be carried out diligently.\n\nThen Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues diligently carried out what King Darius had decreed.

Then I said, \u201cI will no longer shepherd you. Let what is dying die, and let what is going astray go astray; let the rest devour each other\u2019s flesh.\u201d Next I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, annulling the covenant I had made with all the peoples. It was annulled on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew that it was the word of the Lord. Then I said to them, \u201cIf it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.\u201d So they weighed my wages, 30 pieces of silver.\n\n\u201cThrow it to the potter,\u201d the Lord said to me\u2014this magnificent price I was valued by them. So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw it into the house of the Lord, to the potter. Then I cut in two my second staff, Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\n\nThe Lord also said to me: \u201cTake the equipment of a foolish shepherd. I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are going astray, and he will not seek the lost or heal the broken. He will not sustain the healthy, but he will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hooves.\n\nWoe to the worthless shepherd\nwho deserts the flock!\nMay a sword strike his arm\nand his right eye!\nMay his arm wither away\nand his right eye go completely blind!\u201d"

    "Passage": "James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ:\n\nTo the 12 tribes in the Dispersion.\n\nGreetings.\n\nConsider it a great joy, my brothers, whenever you experience various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. But endurance must do its complete work, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.\n\nNow if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without criticizing, and it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith without doubting. For the doubter is like the surging sea, driven and tossed by the wind. That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. An indecisive man is unstable in all his ways.\n\nThe brother of humble circumstances should boast in his exaltation, but the one who is rich should boast in his humiliation because he will pass away like a flower of the field. For the sun rises with its scorching heat and dries up the grass; its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will wither away while pursuing his activities.\n\nA man who endures trials is blessed, because when he passes the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love Him.\n\nNo one undergoing a trial should say, \u201cI am being tempted by God.\u201d For God is not tempted by evil, and He Himself doesn\u2019t tempt anyone. But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desires. Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death.\n\nDon\u2019t be deceived, my dearly loved brothers. Every generous act and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights; with Him there is no variation or shadow cast by turning. By His own choice, He gave us a new birth by the message of truth so that we would be the firstfruits of His creatures."

Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror. For he looks at himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but one who does good works\u2014this person will be blessed in what he does.\n\nIf anyone thinks he is religious without controlling his tongue, then his religion is useless and he deceives himself.

    "Passage": "My brothers, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. For example, a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and a poor man dressed in dirty clothes also comes in. If you look with favor on the man wearing the fine clothes and say, \u201cSit here in a good place,\u201d and yet you say to the poor man, \u201cStand over there,\u201d or, \u201cSit here on the floor by my footstool,\u201d haven\u2019t you discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?\n\nListen, my dear brothers: Didn\u2019t God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He has promised to those who love Him? Yet you dishonored that poor man. Don\u2019t the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts? Don\u2019t they blaspheme the noble name that was pronounced over you at your baptism?\n\nIndeed, if you keep the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, Love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well. But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the entire law, yet fails in one point, is guilty of breaking it all. For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. So if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you are a lawbreaker.\n\nSpeak and act as those who will be judged by the law of freedom. For judgment is without mercy to the one who hasn\u2019t shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."

In the same way faith, if it doesn\u2019t have works, is dead by itself.\n\nBut someone will say, \u201cYou have faith, and I have works.\u201d Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith from my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. The demons also believe\u2014and they shudder.\n\nFoolish man! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless? Wasn\u2019t Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was perfected. So the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness, and he was called God\u2019s friend. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way, wasn\u2019t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by a different route?

But you know his proven character, because he has served with me in the gospel ministry like a son with a father. Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will also come quickly.\n\nBut I considered it necessary to send you Epaphroditus\u2014my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier, as well as your messenger and minister to my need\u2014 since he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was sick. Indeed, he was so sick that he nearly died. However, God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one grief on top of another. For this reason, I am very eager to send him so that you may rejoice when you see him again and I may be less anxious.

By faith he was approved as a righteous man, because God approved his gifts, and even though he is dead, he still speaks through his faith.\n\nBy faith Enoch was taken away so he did not experience death, and he was not to be found because God took him away.

By faith he stayed as a foreigner in the land of promise, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, coheirs of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.\n\nBy faith even Sarah herself, when she was unable to have children, received power to conceive offspring, even though she was past the age, since she considered that the One who had promised was faithful. Therefore from one man\u2014in fact, from one as good as dead\u2014came offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as innumerable as the grains of sand by the seashore.\n\nThese all died in faith without having received the promises, but they saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents on the earth.

(Those who heard it begged that not another word be spoken to them, for they could not bear what was commanded: And if even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned!

Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God (the heavenly Jerusalem), to myriads of angels in festive gathering, to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to God who is the Judge of all, to the spirits of righteous people made perfect, to Jesus (mediator of a new covenant), and to the sprinkled blood, which says better things than the blood of Abel.\n\nMake sure that you do not reject the One who speaks. For if they did not escape when they rejected Him who warned them on earth, even less will we if we turn away from Him who warns us from heaven. His voice shook the earth at that time, but now He has promised, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven. This expression, \u201cYet once more,\u201d indicates the removal of what can be shaken\u2014that is, created things\u2014so that what is not shaken might remain.

You have already heard about this hope in the message of truth, the gospel that has come to you. It is bearing fruit and growing all over the world, just as it has among you since the day you heard it and recognized God\u2019s grace in the truth. You learned this from Epaphras, our dearly loved fellow slave. He is a faithful servant of the Messiah on your behalf, and he has told us about your love in the Spirit.\n\nFor this reason also, since the day we heard this, we haven\u2019t stopped praying for you. We are asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God. May you be strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for all endurance and patience, with joy giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the saints\u2019 inheritance in the light. He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son He loves. We have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, in Him."

You were also circumcised in Him with a circumcision not done with hands, by putting off the body of flesh, in the circumcision of the Messiah. Having been buried with Him in baptism, you were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive with Him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; He triumphed over them by Him."

    "Passage": "Therefore, don\u2019t let anyone judge you in regard to food and drink or in the matter of a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of what was to come; the substance is the Messiah. Let no one disqualify you, insisting on ascetic practices and the worship of angels, claiming access to a visionary realm and inflated without cause by his unspiritual mind. He doesn\u2019t hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and tendons, develops with growth from God.\n\nIf you died with the Messiah to the elemental forces of this world, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations: \u201cDon\u2019t handle, don\u2019t taste, don\u2019t touch\u201d? All these regulations refer to what is destroyed by being used up; they are commands and doctrines of men. Although these have a reputation of wisdom by promoting ascetic practices, humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value in curbing self-indulgence."

    "Prayer Prompt": "Pray for a renewed mind and heart, putting on the new self in Christ each day.",
    "Passage": "So if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God. When the Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.\n\nTherefore, put to death what belongs to your worldly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, God\u2019s wrath comes on the disobedient, and you once walked in these things when you were living in them. But now you must also put away all the following: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self. You are being renewed in knowledge according to the image of your Creator. In Christ there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all."

I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree in the Lord. Yes, I also ask you, true partner, to help these women who have contended for the gospel at my side, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the book of life.

    "Passage": "I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that once again you renewed your care for me. You were, in fact, concerned about me but lacked the opportunity to show it. I don\u2019t say this out of need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. I know both how to have a little, and I know how to have a lot. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being content\u2014whether well fed or hungry, whether in abundance or in need. I am able to do all things through Him who strengthens me. Still, you did well by sharing with me in my hardship.\n\nAnd you Philippians know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone. For even in Thessalonica you sent gifts for my need several times. Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit that is increasing to your account. But I have received everything in full, and I have an abundance. I am fully supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you provided\u2014a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.\n\nGreet every saint in Christ Jesus.

    "Passage": "Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children. And walk in love, as the Messiah also loved us and gave Himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God. But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed should not even be heard of among you, as is proper for saints. Coarse and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks. For know and recognize this: Every sexually immoral or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah and of God.\n\nLet no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God\u2019s wrath is coming on the disobedient because of these things. Therefore, do not become their partners. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light\u2014 for the fruit of the light results in all goodness, righteousness, and truth\u2014 discerning what is pleasing to the Lord. Don\u2019t participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret.

The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze, its legs were iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly fired clay. As you were watching, a stone broke off without a hand touching it, struck the statue on its feet of iron and fired clay, and crushed them. Then the iron, the fired clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were shattered and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.\n\n\u201cThis was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation. Your Majesty, you are king of kings. The God of heaven has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and glory. Wherever people live\u2014or wild animals, or birds of the air\u2014He has handed them over to you and made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold.\n\n\u201cAfter you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours, and then another, a third kingdom, of bronze, which will rule the whole earth.

You saw the iron mixed with clay\u2014the peoples will mix with one another but will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with fired clay.\n\n\u201cIn the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not be left to another people. It will crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself endure forever. You saw a stone break off from the mountain without a hand touching it, and it crushed the iron, bronze, fired clay, silver, and gold. The great God has told the king what will happen in the future.

So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and petitions, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.\n\nI prayed to the Lord my God and confessed:\n\nAh, Lord\u2014the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant with those who love Him and keep His commands\u2014 we have sinned, done wrong, acted wickedly, rebelled, and turned away from Your commands and ordinances. We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, fathers, and all the people of the land.\n\nLord, righteousness belongs to You, but this day public shame belongs to us: the men of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, and all Israel\u2014those who are near and those who are far, in all the countries where You have dispersed them because of the disloyalty they have shown toward You. Lord, public shame belongs to us, our kings, our leaders, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You. Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord our God, though we have rebelled against Him and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by following His instructions that He set before us through His servants the prophets.\n\nAll Israel has broken Your law and turned away, refusing to obey You. The promised curse written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, has been poured out on us because we have sinned against Him. He has carried out His words that He spoke against us and against our rulers by bringing on us so great a disaster that nothing like what has been done to Jerusalem has ever been done under all of heaven. Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not appeased the Lord our God by turning from our iniquities and paying attention to Your truth. So the Lord kept the disaster in mind and brought it on us, for the Lord our God is righteous in all He has done. But we have not obeyed Him.\n\nNow, Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made Your name renowned as it is this day, we have sinned, we have acted wickedly. Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, may Your anger and wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become an object of ridicule to all those around us.\n\nTherefore, our God, hear the prayer and the petitions of Your servant. Show Your favor to Your desolate sanctuary for the Lord\u2019s sake. Listen, my God, and hear. Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city called by Your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before You based on our righteous acts, but based on Your abundant compassion. Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for Your own sake, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.\n\nWhile I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my petition before Yahweh my God concerning the holy mountain of my God\u2014 while I was praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the first vision, came to me in my extreme weariness, about the time of the evening offering. He gave me this explanation: \u201cDaniel, I\u2019ve come now to give you understanding. At the beginning of your petitions an answer went out, and I have come to give it, for you are treasured by God. So consider the message and understand the vision:\n\nSeventy weeks are decreed\nabout your people and your holy city\u2014\nto bring the rebellion to an end,\nto put a stop to sin,\nto wipe away iniquity,\nto bring in everlasting righteousness,\nto seal up vision and prophecy,\nand to anoint the most holy place.\nKnow and understand this:\nFrom the issuing of the decree\nto restore and rebuild Jerusalem\nuntil Messiah the Prince\nwill be seven weeks and 62 weeks.\nIt will be rebuilt with a plaza and a moat,\nbut in difficult times.\nAfter those 62 weeks\nthe Messiah will be cut off\nand will have nothing.\nThe people of the coming prince\nwill destroy the city and the sanctuary.\nThe end will come with a flood,\nand until the end there will be war;\ndesolations are decreed.\nHe will make a firm covenant\nwith many for one week,\nbut in the middle of the week\nhe will put a stop to sacrifice and offering.\nAnd the abomination of desolation\nwill be on a wing of the temple\nuntil the decreed destruction\nis poured out on the desolator.\u201d"

Then God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light \u201cday,\u201d and He called the darkness \u201cnight.\u201d Evening came and then morning: the first day.\n\nThen God said, \u201cLet there be an expanse between the waters, separating water from water.\u201d So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above the expanse. And it was so. God called the expanse \u201csky.\u201d Evening came and then morning: the second day.\n\nThen God said, \u201cLet the water under the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear.\u201d And it was so. God called the dry land \u201cearth,\u201d and He called the gathering of the water \u201cseas.\u201d And God saw that it was good. Then God said, \u201cLet the earth produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds.\u201d And it was so. The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. Evening came and then morning: the third day.\n\nThen God said, \u201cLet there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night. They will serve as signs for festivals and for days and years. They will be lights in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth.\u201d And it was so. God made the two great lights\u2014the greater light to have dominion over the day and the lesser light to have dominion over the night\u2014as well as the stars. God placed them in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth, to dominate the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. Evening came and then morning: the fourth day.\n\nThen God said, \u201cLet the water swarm with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\u201d So God created the large sea-creatures and every living creature that moves and swarms in the water, according to their kinds. He also created every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. So God blessed them, \u201cBe fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.\u201d Evening came and then morning: the fifth day.\n\nThen God said, \u201cLet the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds.\u201d And it was so. So God made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.\n\nThen God said, \u201cLet Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, all the earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth.\u201d\n\nSo God created man in His own image;\nHe created him in the image of God;\nHe created them male and female.\nGod blessed them, and God said to them, \u201cBe fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth.\u201d God also said, \u201cLook, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the surface of the entire earth and every tree whose fruit contains seed. This food will be for you, for all the wildlife of the earth, for every bird of the sky, and for every creature that crawls on the earth\u2014everything having the breath of life in it. I have given every green plant for food.\u201d And it was so. God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. Evening came and then morning: the sixth day."

He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar on top of the wood.

    "Passage": "When the Lord saw that man\u2019s wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every scheme his mind thought of was nothing but evil all the time, the Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. Then the Lord said, \u201cI will wipe off from the face of the earth mankind, whom I created, together with the animals, creatures that crawl, and birds of the sky\u2014for I regret that I made them.\u201d Noah, however, found favor in the sight of the Lord.\n\nThese are the family records of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries; Noah walked with God. And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\nNow the earth was corrupt in God\u2019s sight, and the earth was filled with wickedness. God saw how corrupt the earth was, for every creature had corrupted its way on the earth. Then God said to Noah, \u201cI have decided to put an end to every creature, for the earth is filled with wickedness because of them; therefore I am going to destroy them along with the earth.\n\n\u201cMake yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it with pitch inside and outside. This is how you are to make it: The ark will be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. You are to make a roof, finishing the sides of the ark to within 18 inches of the roof. You are to put a door in the side of the ark. Make it with lower, middle, and upper decks.\n\n\u201cUnderstand that I am bringing a flood\u2014floodwaters on the earth to destroy every creature under heaven with the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will die. But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark with your sons, your wife, and your sons\u2019 wives. You are also to bring into the ark two of all the living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Two of everything\u2014from the birds according to their kinds, from the livestock according to their kinds, and from the animals that crawl on the ground according to their kinds\u2014will come to you so that you can keep them alive. Take with you every kind of food that is eaten; gather it as food for you and for them.\u201d And Noah did this. He did everything that God had commanded him."

Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran. He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated, and the people he had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, Abram passed through the land to the site of Shechem, at the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, \u201cI will give this land to your offspring.\u201d So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him. From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to Yahweh there, and he called on the name of Yahweh. Then Abram journeyed by stages to the Negev.\n\nThere was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine in the land was severe. When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, \u201cLook, I know what a beautiful woman you are. When the Egyptians see you, they will say, \u2018This is his wife.\u2019 They will kill me but let you live. Please say you\u2019re my sister so it will go well for me because of you, and my life will be spared on your account.\u201d When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. Pharaoh\u2019s officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, so the woman was taken to Pharaoh\u2019s household. He treated Abram well because of her, and Abram acquired flocks and herds, male and female donkeys, male and female slaves, and camels.\n\nBut the Lord struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram\u2019s wife Sarai. So Pharaoh sent for Abram and said, \u201cWhat have you done to me? Why didn\u2019t you tell me she was your wife? Why did you say, \u2018She\u2019s my sister,\u2019 so that I took her as my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and go!\u201d Then Pharaoh gave his men orders about him, and they sent him away with his wife and all he had."

    "Passage": "Abram\u2019s wife Sarai had not borne any children for him, but she owned an Egyptian slave named Hagar. Sarai said to Abram, \u201cSince the Lord has prevented me from bearing children, go to my slave; perhaps through her I can build a family.\u201d And Abram agreed to what Sarai said. So Abram\u2019s wife Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian slave, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife for him. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan 10 years. He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she treated her mistress with contempt. Then Sarai said to Abram, \u201cYou are responsible for my suffering! I put my slave in your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the Lord judge between me and you.\u201d\n\nAbram replied to Sarai, \u201cHere, your slave is in your hands; do whatever you want with her.\u201d Then Sarai mistreated her so much that she ran away from her.\n\nThe Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. He said, \u201cHagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?\u201d\n\nShe replied, \u201cI\u2019m running away from my mistress Sarai.\u201d\n\nThen the Angel of the Lord said to her, \u201cYou must go back to your mistress and submit to her mistreatment.\u201d The Angel of the Lord also said to her, \u201cI will greatly multiply your offspring, and they will be too many to count.\u201d\n\nThen the Angel of the Lord said to her:\n\nYou have conceived and will have a son.\nYou will name him Ishmael,\nfor the Lord has heard your cry of affliction.\nThis man will be like a wild donkey.\nHis hand will be against everyone,\nand everyone\u2019s hand will be against him;\nhe will live at odds with all his brothers.\nSo she called the Lord who spoke to her: The God Who Sees, for she said, \u201cIn this place, have I actually seen the One who sees me?\u201d That is why she named the spring, \u201cA Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.\u201d It is located between Kadesh and Bered.\n\nSo Hagar gave birth to Abram\u2019s son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son Hagar had.

Now the girl was very beautiful, a young woman who had not known a man intimately. She went down to the spring, filled her jug, and came up.

As Moses looked, he saw that the bush was on fire but was not consumed. So Moses thought: I must go over and look at this remarkable sight.

Now please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.\n\n\u201cHowever, I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go, unless he is forced by a strong hand. I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles that I will perform in it. After that, he will let you go. And I will give these people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. Each woman will ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters.

It was reported to Joshua: \u201cThe five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.\u201d\n\nJoshua said, \u201cRoll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and station men by it to guard the kings. But as for the rest of you, don\u2019t stay there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Don\u2019t let them enter their cities, for the Lord your God has handed them over to you.\u201d So Joshua and the Israelites finished inflicting a terrible slaughter on them until they were destroyed, although a few survivors ran away to the fortified cities. The people returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. And no one dared to threaten the Israelites.\n\nThen Joshua said, \u201cOpen the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of there.\u201d That is what they did. They brought the five kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon to Joshua out of the cave. When they had brought the kings to him, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the military commanders who had accompanied him, \u201cCome here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.\u201d So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks. Joshua said to them, \u201cDo not be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and courageous, for the Lord will do this to all the enemies you fight.\u201d\n\nAfter this, Joshua struck them down and executed them. He hung their bodies on five trees and they were there until evening. At sunset Joshua commanded that they be taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave where they had hidden. Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave, and the stones are there to this day."

As for me and my family, we will worship Yahweh.\u201d\n\nThe people replied, \u201cWe will certainly not abandon the Lord to worship other gods! For the Lord our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, and performed these great signs before our eyes. He also protected us all along the way we went and among all the peoples whose lands we traveled through. The Lord drove out before us all the peoples, including the Amorites who lived in the land.

If you abandon the Lord and worship foreign gods, He will turn against you, harm you, and completely destroy you, after He has been good to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d the people answered Joshua. \u201cWe will worship the Lord.\u201d\n\nJoshua then told the people, \u201cYou are witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen to worship Yahweh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are witnesses,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThen get rid of the foreign gods that are among you and offer your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel.\u201d\n\nSo the people said to Joshua, \u201cWe will worship the Lord our God and obey Him.\u201d\n\nOn that day Joshua made a covenant for the people at Shechem and established a statute and ordinance for them.

After Eglon convinced the Ammonites and the Amalekites to join forces with him, he attacked and defeated Israel and took possession of the City of Palms. The Israelites served Eglon king of Moab 18 years.\n\nThen the Israelites cried out to the Lord, and He raised up Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed Benjaminite, as a deliverer for them. The Israelites sent him to Eglon king of Moab with tribute money.\n\nEhud made himself a double-edged sword 18 inches long. He strapped it to his right thigh under his clothes and brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was an extremely fat man. When Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the people who had carried it. At the carved images near Gilgal he returned and said, \u201cKing Eglon, I have a secret message for you.\u201d The king called for silence, and all his attendants left him. Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in his room upstairs where it was cool. Ehud said, \u201cI have a word from God for you,\u201d and the king stood up from his throne. Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon\u2019s belly. Even the handle went in after the blade, and Eglon\u2019s fat closed in over it, so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly. And Eglon\u2019s insides came out. Ehud escaped by way of the porch, closing and locking the doors of the upstairs room behind him.\n\nEhud was gone when Eglon\u2019s servants came in. They looked and found the doors of the upstairs room locked and thought he was relieving himself in the cool room. The servants waited until they became worried and saw that he had still not opened the doors of the upstairs room. So they took the key and opened the doors\u2014and there was their lord lying dead on the floor!\n\nEhud escaped while the servants waited. He crossed over the Jordan near the carved images and reached Seirah. After he arrived, he sounded the ram\u2019s horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites came down with him from the hill country, and he became their leader. He told them, \u201cFollow me, because the Lord has handed over your enemies, the Moabites, to you.\u201d So they followed him, captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over. At that time they struck down about 10,000 Moabites, all strong and able-bodied men. Not one of them escaped. Moab became subject to Israel that day, and the land was peaceful 80 years."

The ark is called by the Name, the name of Yahweh of Hosts who dwells between the cherubim. They set the ark of God on a new cart and transported it from Abinadab\u2019s house, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the cart and brought it with the ark of God from Abinadab\u2019s house on the hill. Ahio walked in front of the ark. David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating before the Lord with all kinds of fir wood instruments, lyres, harps, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.\n\nWhen they came to Nacon\u2019s threshing floor, Uzzah reached out to the ark of God and took hold of it because the oxen had stumbled. Then the Lord\u2019s anger burned against Uzzah, and God struck him dead on the spot for his irreverence, and he died there next to the ark of God. David was angry because of the Lord\u2019s outburst against Uzzah, so he named that place an Outburst Against Uzzah, as it is today. David feared the Lord that day and said, \u201cHow can the ark of the Lord ever come to me?\u201d So he was not willing to move the ark of the Lord to the city of David; instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. The ark of the Lord remained in his house three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and his whole family.\n\nIt was reported to King David: \u201cThe Lord has blessed Obed-edom\u2019s family and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God.\u201d So David went and had the ark of God brought up from Obed-edom\u2019s house to the city of David with rejoicing.

When you arrive, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram. You are to anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah as prophet in your place.

    "Passage": "Some time passed after these events. Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard; it was in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, \u201cGive me your vineyard so I can have it for a vegetable garden, since it is right next to my palace. I will give you a better vineyard in its place, or if you prefer, I will give you its value in silver.\u201d\n\nBut Naboth said to Ahab, \u201cI will never give my fathers\u2019 inheritance to you.\u201d\n\nSo Ahab went to his palace resentful and angry because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had told him. He had said, \u201cI will not give you my fathers\u2019 inheritance.\u201d He lay down on his bed, turned his face away, and didn\u2019t eat any food.\n\nThen his wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, \u201cWhy are you so upset that you refuse to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite,\u201d he replied. \u201cI told him: Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you wish, I will give you a vineyard in its place. But he said, \u2018I won\u2019t give you my vineyard!\u2019\u201d\n\nThen his wife Jezebel said to him, \u201cNow, exercise your royal power over Israel. Get up, eat some food, and be happy. For I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\u201d So she wrote letters in Ahab\u2019s name and sealed them with his seal. She sent the letters to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. In the letters, she wrote:\n\nProclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people. Then seat two wicked men opposite him and have them testify against him, saying, \u201cYou have cursed God and the king!\u201d Then take him out and stone him to death.\n\nThe men of his city, the elders and nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had commanded them, as was written in the letters she had sent them. They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people. The two wicked men came in and sat opposite him. Then the wicked men testified against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, \u201cNaboth has cursed God and the king!\u201d So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. Then they sent word to Jezebel, \u201cNaboth has been stoned to death.\u201d\n\nWhen Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, \u201cGet up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite who refused to give it to you for silver, since Naboth isn\u2019t alive, but dead.\u201d When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.\n\nThen the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite: \u201cGet up and go to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. You\u2019ll find him in Naboth\u2019s vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. Tell him, \u2018This is what the Lord says: Have you murdered and also taken possession?\u2019 Then tell him, \u2018This is what the Lord says: In the place where the dogs licked Naboth\u2019s blood, the dogs will also lick your blood!\u2019\u201d\n\nAhab said to Elijah, \u201cSo, you have caught me, my enemy.\u201d\n\nHe replied, \u201cI have caught you because you devoted yourself to do what is evil in the Lord\u2019s sight. This is what the Lord says: \u2018I am about to bring disaster on you and will sweep away your descendants:\n\nI will eliminate all of Ahab\u2019s males,\nboth slave and free, in Israel;\nI will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked My anger and caused Israel to sin. The Lord also speaks of Jezebel: The dogs will eat Jezebel in the plot of land at Jezreel:\n\nHe who belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, the dogs will eat,\nand he who dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.\u2019\u201d\nStill, there was no one like Ahab, who devoted himself to do what was evil in the Lord\u2019s sight, because his wife Jezebel incited him. He committed the most detestable acts by going after idols as the Amorites had, whom the Lord had dispossessed before the Israelites.\n\nWhen Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth over his body, and fasted. He lay down in sackcloth and walked around subdued. Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite: \u201cHave you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? I will not bring the disaster during his lifetime, because he has humbled himself before Me. I will bring the disaster on his house during his son\u2019s lifetime.\u201d"

Be quiet.\u201d\n\nElijah said to him, \u201cElisha, stay here; the Lord is sending me to Jericho.\u201d\n\nBut Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.\u201d So they went to Jericho.\n\nThen the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho came up to Elisha and said, \u201cDo you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, I know.

Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the waters, which parted to the right and left. Then the two of them crossed over on dry ground. After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cTell me what I can do for you before I am taken from you.\u201d\n\nSo Elisha answered, \u201cPlease, let me inherit two shares of your spirit.\u201d\n\nElijah replied, \u201cYou have asked for something difficult. If you see me being taken from you, you will have it. If not, you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire with horses of fire suddenly appeared and separated the two of them. Then Elijah went up into heaven in the whirlwind. As Elisha watched, he kept crying out, \u201cMy father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!\u201d Then he never saw Elijah again. He took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.\n\nElisha picked up the mantle that had fallen off Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. Then he took the mantle Elijah had dropped and struck the waters. \u201cWhere is the Lord God of Elijah?\u201d he asked. He struck the waters himself, and they parted to the right and the left, and Elisha crossed over.\n\nWhen the sons of the prophets from Jericho who were facing him saw him, they said, \u201cThe spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.\u201d They came to meet him and bowed down to the ground in front of him."

The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever.” Zion, herald of good news, go up on a high mountain. Jerusalem, herald of good news, raise your voice loudly.

Yet he himself bore our sicknesses, and he carried our pains; but we in turn regarded him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds. We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the Lord has punished him for the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter and like a sheep silent before her shearers, he did not open his mouth. He was taken away because of oppression and judgment, and who considered his fate? For he was cut off from the land of the living; he was struck because of my people’s rebellion. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, but he was with a rich man at his death, because he had done no violence and had not spoken deceitfully. Yet the Lord was pleased to crush him severely. When you make him a guilt offering, he will see his seed, he will prolong his days, and by his hand, the Lord’s pleasure will be accomplished. After his anguish, he will see light and be satisfied. By his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many, and he will carry their iniquities. Therefore I will give him the many as a portion, and he will receive the mighty as spoil, because he willingly submitted to death and was counted among the rebels; yet he bore the sin of many and interceded for the rebels."

Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and asked them the exact time the star appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, 'Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report back to me so that I too can go and worship him.' After hearing the king, they went on their way. And there it was—the star they had seen at its rising. It led them until it came and stopped above the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overwhelmed with joy. Entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and falling to their knees, they worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route."

All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."

Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be consoled, because they are no more."

It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he saw the Lord’s Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, he entered the temple.

For my eyes have seen your salvation. You have prepared it in the presence of all peoples—a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to your people Israel.'

There was also a prophetess, Anna, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well along in years, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, and was a widow for eighty-four years. She did not leave the temple, serving God night and day with fasting and prayers. At that very moment, she came up and began to thank God and to speak about him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem."

    "Passage": "Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. Then the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire within a bush. As Moses looked, he saw that the bush was on fire but was not consumed. So Moses thought: I must go over and look at this remarkable sight. Why isn\u2019t the bush burning up?\n\nWhen the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from the bush, \u201cMoses, Moses!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cDo not come closer,\u201d He said. \u201cRemove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.\u201d Then He continued, \u201cI am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\u201d Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.\n\nThen the Lord said, \u201cI have observed the misery of My people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I know about their sufferings. I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey\u2014the territory of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. The Israelites\u2019 cry for help has come to Me, and I have also seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. Therefore, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may lead My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.\u201d\n\nBut Moses asked God, \u201cWho am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?\u201d\n\nHe answered, \u201cI will certainly be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will all worship God at this mountain.\u201d\n\nThen Moses asked God, \u201cIf I go to the Israelites and say to them: The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, \u2018What is His name?\u2019 what should I tell them?\u201d\n\nGod replied to Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.\u201d God also said to Moses, \u201cSay this to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.\n\n\u201cGo and assemble the elders of Israel and say to them: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I have paid close attention to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt. And I have promised you that I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites\u2014a land flowing with milk and honey. They will listen to what you say. Then you, along with the elders of Israel, must go to the king of Egypt and say to him: Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.\n\n\u201cHowever, I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go, unless he is forced by a strong hand. I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles that I will perform in it. After that, he will let you go. And I will give these people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. Each woman will ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.\u201d"

I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but I did not reveal My name Yahweh to them.

They said, \u201cWhy did you ever bring us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?\u201d\n\nThen Moses cried out to the Lord, \u201cWhat should I do with these people? In a little while they will stone me!\u201d\n\nThe Lord answered Moses, \u201cGo on ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take the staff you struck the Nile with in your hand and go. I am going to stand there in front of you on the rock at Horeb; when you hit the rock, water will come out of it and the people will drink.\u201d Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. He named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites complained, and because they tested the Lord, saying, \u201cIs the Lord among us or not?\u201d\n\nAt Rephidim, Amalek came and fought against Israel. Moses said to Joshua, \u201cSelect some men for us and go fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the hilltop with God\u2019s staff in my hand.\u201d\n\nJoshua did as Moses had told him, and fought against Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. While Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, but whenever he put his hand down, Amalek prevailed. When Moses\u2019 hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat down on it. Then Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down. So Joshua defeated Amalek and his army with the sword.\n\nThe Lord then said to Moses, \u201cWrite this down on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua: I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek under heaven.\u201d\n\nAnd Moses built an altar and named it, \u201cThe Lord Is My Banner.\u201d He said, \u201cIndeed, my hand is lifted up toward the Lord\u2019s throne.

For we have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings you completely destroyed across the Jordan. When we heard this, we lost heart, and everyone\u2019s courage failed because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on earth below. Now please swear to me by the Lord that you will also show kindness to my family, because I showed kindness to you. Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and save us from death.\u201d\n\nThe men answered her, \u201cWe will give our lives for yours.

Bring your father, mother, brothers, and all your father\u2019s family into your house. If anyone goes out the doors of your house, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent.

This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males\u2014all the men of war\u2014had died in the wilderness along the way after they had come out of Egypt. Though all the people who came out were circumcised, none of the people born in the wilderness along the way were circumcised after they had come out of Egypt. For the Israelites wandered in the wilderness 40 years until all the nation\u2019s men of war who came out of Egypt had died off because they did not obey the Lord. So the Lord vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. Joshua raised up their sons in their place; it was these he circumcised. They were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way. After the entire nation had been circumcised, they stayed where they were in the camp until they recovered. The Lord then said to Joshua, \u201cToday I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.\u201d Therefore, that place is called Gilgal to this day.\n\nWhile the Israelites camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month. The day after Passover they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land. And the day after they ate from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. Since there was no more manna for the Israelites, they ate from the crops of the land of Canaan that year.\n\nWhen Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand.

Am I not sending you?\u201d\n\nHe said to Him, \u201cPlease, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father\u2019s house.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I will be with you,\u201d the Lord said to him. \u201cYou will strike Midian down as if it were one man.\u201d\n\nThen he said to Him, \u201cIf I have found favor in Your sight, give me a sign that You are speaking with me. Please do not leave this place until I return to You. Let me bring my gift and set it before You.\u201d\n\nAnd He said, \u201cI will stay until you return.\u201d\n\nSo Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from a half bushel of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. He brought them out and offered them to Him under the oak.\n\nThe Angel of God said to him, \u201cTake the meat with the unleavened bread, put it on this stone, and pour the broth on it.\u201d And he did so.\n\nThe Angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that was in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire came up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.\n\nWhen Gideon realized that He was the Angel of the Lord, he said, \u201cOh no, Lord God! I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!\u201d\n\nBut the Lord said to him, \u201cPeace to you. Don\u2019t be afraid, for you will not die.\u201d So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it Yahweh Shalom. It is in Ophrah of the Abiezrites until today.\n"
