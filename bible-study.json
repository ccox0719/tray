    "Passage": "Then God said, \u201cLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\u201d\n\nSo God created mankind in his own image,\n    in the image of God he created them;\n    male and female he created them.\nGod blessed them and said to them, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\u201d\n\nThen God said, \u201cI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground\u2014everything that has the breath of life in it\u2014I give every green plant for food.\u201d And it was so.\n\nGod saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the sixth day.\n\nThus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.\n\nBy the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.\n\nThis is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.\n\nNow no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.\n\nNow the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground\u2014trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nA river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n\nThe Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the Lord God commanded the man, \u201cYou are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.\u201d\n\nThe Lord God said, \u201cIt is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\u201d\n\nNow the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.\n\nBut for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man\u2019s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.\n\nThe man said,\n\n\u201cThis is now bone of my bones\n    and flesh of my flesh;\nshe shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019\n    for she was taken out of man.\u201d\nThat is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.\n\nAdam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.",

    "Passage": "Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, \u201cDid God really say, \u2018You can\u2019t eat from any tree in the garden\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe woman said to the serpent, \u201cWe may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden. But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, \u2018You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! You will not die,\u201d the serpent said to the woman. \u201cIn fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d Then the woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.\n\nThen the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid themselves from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. So the Lord God called out to the man and said to him, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\nAnd he said, \u201cI heard You in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.\u201d\n\nThen He asked, \u201cWho told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?\u201d\n\nThen the man replied, \u201cThe woman You gave to be with me\u2014she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate.\u201d\n\nSo the Lord God asked the woman, \u201cWhat is this you have done?\u201d\n\nAnd the woman said, \u201cIt was the serpent. He deceived me, and I ate.\u201d\n\nThen the Lord God said to the serpent:\n\nBecause you have done this,\nyou are cursed more than any livestock\nand more than any wild animal.\nYou will move on your belly\nand eat dust all the days of your life.\nI will put hostility between you and the woman,\nand between your seed and her seed.\nHe will strike your head,\nand you will strike his heel.\nHe said to the woman:\n\nI will intensify your labor pains;\nyou will bear children in anguish.\nYour desire will be for your husband,\nyet he will rule over you.\nAnd He said to Adam, \u201cBecause you listened to your wife\u2019s voice and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, \u2018Do not eat from it\u2019:\n\nThe ground is cursed because of you.\nYou will eat from it by means of painful labor\nall the days of your life.\nIt will produce thorns and thistles for you,\nand you will eat the plants of the field.\nYou will eat bread by the sweat of your brow\nuntil you return to the ground,\nsince you were taken from it.\nFor you are dust,\nand you will return to dust.\u201d\nAdam named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living. The Lord God made clothing out of skins for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them.\n\nThe Lord God said, \u201cSince man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil, he must not reach out, take from the tree of life, eat, and live forever.\u201d So the Lord God sent him away from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove man out and stationed the cherubim and the flaming, whirling sword east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of life.",
